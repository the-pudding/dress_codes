The girls held up outside of our middle school dance because their shoulders and underarms were bare. Holding my arms by my sides while an administrator checked the length of my shorts.

Each of these took place in school as adults tried to enforce the school dress code."},{"type":"text","value":"I wish I could say that dress codes like these stayed in the mid-2000's with other fashion icons of the time.
