I remembered the girls stopped outside of our middle school dance because their shoulders and underarms were bare. Holding my arms by my sides while an administrator checked the length of my shorts. Being handed a detention slip because a small sliver of the skin on my torso was exposed. Each of these took place in school as adults tried to enforce the school dress code."},{"type":"text","value":"The thing is, dress codes are tricky. These rules were written, seemingly, in an attempt to cover up our bodies and prevent them from being sexualized.
