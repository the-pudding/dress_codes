burden of dress code enforcement.
• Students should not face unnecessary barriers to school attendance.
• Reasons for conflict and inconsistent discipline should be minimized whenever
possible.

goals of the school and are explained within the dress code.
1. Basic Principle: Certain body parts must be covered for all students

assignment-specific dress, but should not focus on covering girls’ bodies or
promoting culturally-specific attire.
3. Students May Wear:
• Hats, including religious headwear
• Hoodie sweatshirts (over head is allowed)
• Fitted pants, including leggings, yoga pants and “skinny jeans”
• Midriff baring shirts
• Pajamas
• Ripped jeans, as long as underwear is not exposed.

culture that reinforces a variety of career and college ready skills. While we
recognize many of the current fashion trends are modest and respectful, the
challenge we are embracing is teaching students to know the difference between
social and professional attire. The building administration and staff want to
partner with the Dakota community to adhere to a school dress code that is
focused on meeting this challenge and establishing a culture that promotes career
and college readiness. Therefore the following suggestions are guidelines to
assist families in determining if your student is dress appropriately for school but
are not intended to be an inclusive list of the Dakota dress code.
Student Dress should have a school appropriate message:
 Clothing, jewelry, and visible tattoos cannot advertise tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, which
is consistent with our mission to provide a drug free and safe learning environment.
 All clothing and accessories should not have vulgar designs, messages, or be sexually
suggestive.
 Clothing and accessories should not harass or defame any person or group of people.
Additionally, no item should promote a hate group or suggest disloyalty to our Nation,
State, and school.
Student Dress should promote a safe learning environment:
 Students should wear appropriate shoes to school and avoid wearing slippers
 Book bags should be limited to the draw string bag that carries a maximum of 3 books.
Large back packs and purses pose a safety hazard for individual students and peers.
Having large bags in classrooms is a trip hazard for staff and students. Additionally,
large bags increase the crowding in the hallways and potential for conflicts to arise.
 Clothing, accessories, and fashion should not have sharp, pointed, or projectile type
objects.
Student Dress should promote respect for self and others:
 Jeans with holes above the knee are not permitted at school.
 Shorts, skirts, and dresses should be an appropriate length and extend beyond the
finger tips of out stretched arms.
 Tank tops, muscle shirts, and sleeveless tops are not permitted at school.
 All shirts should cover the waist line and not expose a bare midriff. Additionally, tops
should not have neck line or material that is revealing of undergarments.
 Pants and shorts should be worn in a manner that does not expose the students
undergarments
 During school hours all hats, scarves, and headbands are not to be worn, which is
consistent with other governmental buildings like courts, offices, and places of worship.
 During school hours coats and other outdoor gear should be placed in the student’s
locker.
 Leggings are not considered appropriate attire for school as pants. If leggings are worn
to school they should have a top of appropriate length, which is measured by being
finger tip length when arms are at a student’s side.
The Dakota staff is committed to monitoring the dress code. As partners in this
process, please have your student(s) do a self assessment prior to leaving for
school to evaluate if they are dress for success. The building administration
reserves the right to be the authority in determining if a student(s) is meeting this
standard. If a student arrives to school and is not prepared to meet this standard
the following should happen:
 Students will be offered an opportunity to change their clothing and/or remove their
accessories. If available some school issued pants and tops will be offered, provided the
student agrees to clean and return the items to school the following day.
 Students can contact their parents to have appropriate clothing delivered to school.
 Students who are in violation of the dress code multiple times are likely to receive
additional consequences ranging from detention to suspension.",http://dakotacougardays.weebly.com/uploads/3/1/9/8/3198955/dress_for_success_2013.pdf,,,not specified,not specified,not specified,not specified,"appropriate, safe/safety, disrespectful",2018 - 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fads. In these cases, building administrators will determine the appropriateness of the student’s appearance
and will determine whether his or her appearance is disruptive to the learning environment or is
inappropriate for safety reasons. It is understood that some exceptions may be necessary, if there are
valid health/medical or religious reasons. Students must obtain written approval from building administrators
in advance, if they believe it is necessary for them to wear clothing or appear at school in a way
that does not meet the dress code standards.
Violation of the Dress Code – Upon seeing a student in violation of the dress code, teachers or staff
members will submit a referral in Infinite Campus for the student. When possible the classroom teacher
will send the student to the Dean’s office the last few minutes of the class period. In extreme cases, it
might be necessary to refer the student to the Dean’s office immediately. First Offense – a disciplinary
referral will be logged and parent contact will be made. Second Offense (and all thereafter) – a disciplinary
referral will be logged and the offense will be considered a failure to comply with school rules
(see rule #17) and the appropriate consequence will be assigned.
DRESS CODE STANDARDS
Students are expected to maintain an appearance that is appropriate for school and conducive to the
educational atmosphere. Whenever a school official considers a student’s appearance to be inappropriate,
immodest or distracting to the educational environment, a conference will be held and the student
will be asked to make the necessary accommodations. The following are examples of clothing or items
that are considered to be inappropriate:
• Clothing and/or any adornment displaying messages not appropriate for school. Examples would be
messages containing profanity, sexual innuendo, depicting violence, and references to drugs, alcoholic
beverages or tobacco products
• Clothing revealing bare midriffs, shirts and tops must be able to be tucked in
• Clothing which reveals undergarments or the lack of undergarments
37
• No head coverings, except those worn for religious purposes, may be worn. Other requests must be
submitted in writing to the principal. Hats are not to be carried or displayed. Examples of headwear
would be sweatbands, scarves, bandanas and earmuffs.
• Heavy winter or long coats worn in class or throughout the school day in the building
• House slippers and gloves
• Sagging pants or shorts worn more than two inches below the hips
• Shorts, pants, skirts and dresses need to be of an appropriate length. The guide to use is the length of
the fingers as the arm hangs down the side

a concern for student safety
