guidelines to be followed:
1. Unusual hairstyles considered to be inappropriate in a school setting will not be permitted. This

inappropriate.

administrators before purchasing questionable clothing or changing personal appearance in a way
that according to these guidelines might be considered inappropriate.","modest/modesty, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, interfere with learning, teach grooming and hygiene",none,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,"pillows:NA, stuffed animals:NA","dresses, skirts, shorts","""short""/""inappropriate length"" (no exact measurement given), top of the kneecap",,,none,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"strapless dresses:NA, sundresses:NA",,,,,,none,,none,,,,to the edge of the shoulder,excessively long t-shirts:NA,,,none,,,none,,,,none,,,none,none,,none,,,none,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,none,none,none,,,,none,,,,,,"buttoned appropriately:NA, not worn appropriately:NA","gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, vulgarity/profanity, offensive",,none,male,,,,,none,none,,none,,,"gang-related tattoos:NA, excessive tattoos:NA, excessive hair length:NA, design cut into hair: NA, untrimmed facial hair:NA, unusual make-up:NA",,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,Any,,,,,,Any,Any,removed from extra-curricular activities:Any,yes,"Judgment on the modesty of a student’s dress lies with administration...All

to dress in a manner that supports a positive
learning environment. Daily dress should not
cause distractions and disruptions.","Northbridge High School respects individual rights of expression; however each student is expected to dress
responsibly to uphold the standards of the school environment. Appropriate dress has a positive impact on
student learning, concentration, behavior, and the overall educational environment. We believe that NHS
students should take pride in their personal appearance. With this in mind, in an effort to create a safe
environment, appropriate dress should be worn for both the school day and all events that are sponsored by the
school:
Students are expected to exercise good judgment in their style of dress as well as demonstrate respect for those
around them.
Dress that distracts or disrupts the educational process and mission of the school is prohibited.
The basic guidelines of decency, modesty, good taste, cleanliness and practicality should prevail. At all times,
students should treat school as if it were a place of business and dress accordingly. Research has proven that
when students dress this way it promotes a more serious atmosphere and students take school more seriously.
Inappropriate dress includes, but is not limited to:
1. Designs on clothing which display poor taste, advocate for drugs, alcohol, sex or tobacco, or that is
uncomfortably revealing and causes embarrassment to others.

No undergarments should show at any time including boxer shorts or bras.

2. Designs on clothing, which displays inappropriate symbols, language, ethnic slurs, or any attire which could
be construed as offensive to anyone in the building.
3. Dress intended for outside wear or other material that covers the face and/or interferes with the identification
of a student such as HATS, visors, hoods, bandanas, sunglasses, etc. are prohibited. Wearing hats in a public
building is generally considered inappropriate except when wearing for religious reasons or relating to a
disability.
Such items should be removed upon entering the building and MUST be stored in the student‟s locker for the
day.
Any teacher may confiscate hats, sunglasses, or headphones that are not stored in the student‟s locker during
school hours. Student‟s refusing to turn over the items will be cited for insubordination and face disciplinary consequences.Chains, wallet chains and/or spiked collars/bracelets or any non-school related item that could be used as a
weapon are prohibited.
5. Jackets, coats, or other outerwear may not be worn during the school day and should be stored in lockers.
6. Backpacks, or shoulder packs, of any type must be stored in lockers during the school day.
7. Appropriate footwear must be worn at all times.
8. No bare midriffs or shoulders, visible under garments, or equivalent types.(e.g. spaghetti straps, halter
tops, tube tops, muscle shirts ) Tank tops must have straps that are a minimum of 3 fingers wide with no visible
undergarments)
9. Length of shorts, and „skorts‟ must be no more than 4-5” above the knee or at least mid-thigh (whichever is
LONGER) Skirts and dresses that are less than knee length must have some type of undergarment (e.g. tights,
spandex, other shorts) worn that meets the same criteria as the length of shorts. Note: Rips or holes in garments
must be below the minimum length requirement as stated and may not be worn if they are inappropriately
revealing.
If a violation occurs, students will be required to correct the situation. Corrective action may include a change of
clothes, turning an item inside out, dismissal from school after parent/guardian notification, or any other
appropriate and reasonable means of redress. Failure to comply with this request could result in disciplinary action and possible suspension.","modest/modesty, appropriate/inappropriate, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, respect/disrespect, interfere with learning, professional/business, pride, good judgment, decency, good taste, clean, practical, serious",,none,none,,,,none,,,,,none,,none,,,none,,"headphones:NA, wallet chains:NA, backpacks:NA","dresses, skirts, shorts, skorts","shorter than the knee, shorter than x inches from knee (insert amount in other), 4-5 from knee (shorts/skorts), shorter than knee (skirts/dresses)",,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,none,,none,,none,"less than x fingers (insert amount in other), 3",,,,,none,,none,,,,,,,none,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,none,,"religious, medical",,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,causes embarrassment to others:NA,"alcohol, tobacco, drugs, discriminatory, offensive, poor taste, sex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,none,,,,,Any,,,,Any,,Any,Any,,Any,,,no,,

The following guidelines apply except for school-wide events where special dress is permitted.

Overall expectations for all students:

All students are expected to be neat and clean.
All should be modestly dressed in attire appropriate to the classroom. Modesty means that no bellies, breasts, buttocks, or underwear should be showing. This should be true when climbing stairs, sitting at a desk as well as standing. Garments should not be transparent or sheer, without a dress code appropriate garment underneath.
Dress or appearance disruptive to the learning process will not be tolerated.
All clothing must be neat and clean and free of rips and tears. No raw fabric edges should be exposed.

Head coverings (such as hats, hoods, or bandanas) will not be worn in school, except for medical or religious exemption as approved by Headmaster.
Appropriate footwear is required at all times; slippers are not permitted.
Shirt requirements:
Material of the shirt must have at least a “three finger’s” width strap.
The sleeve must be hemmed and sewn with no raw edges.
Shirts must cover the entire midriff.
Inappropriate pictures or lettering are not allowed on shirts or other clothing.  This includes advertising for alcoholic beverages or alcohol/drug/tobacco related messages, weapons, violent acts, sexual innuendo, or derogatory or threatening statements.  Clothing that contains images or messages that prompt social injustice is also deemed inappropriate.
Shorts will be allowed throughout the year. Short restrictions:
Athletic shorts (with or without pockets), cutoff shorts, and shorts with holes or rips are not permitted.
Students in classes conducting outdoor activities during wet or cool weather cannot use the wearing of shorts as a valid excuse for non-participation.  Students should dress appropriately for the planned activities.
Length of shorts must be modest in nature (see Overall Expectations #2.)
Shorts are not appropriate for field trips.
All students will have extra clothing for physical education class and will change for class when required.
Students will wear protective clothing when required for class – such items as laboratory aprons, coveralls, safety glasses, etc.

No chains of any kind may be worn.
ENFORCEMENT
Students who do not adhere to these requirements will not be permitted to attend class or the activity involved until the dress code violation has been remedied.

A student whose manner of dress appears to be in violation will be immediately sent to their guidance counselor.  (If their regular counselor is unavailable, another counselor will address the situation).  If their style of dress is indeed in violation of the dress code an administrative referral will be filed, and:

First Dress Code Violation
The student will be required to change to appropriate clothing before being allowed to return to class.  If they do not have appropriate clothing with them, they will either have to borrow such clothing from another student (no interruptions of another student’s class will be allowed) or they will have to contact a parent to bring them school appropriate attire.

Students will remain in the guidance waiting area until such time as they have appropriate dress.  They will not return to class until the situation is resolved.  If lunch period comes during the time the student is waiting for clothes to change, the student may go to the dining hall to get lunch but will return immediately to the guidance area to eat.

Second Dress Code Violation
Same as above plus an administrative detention will be assigned.

Third Dress Code Violation (and any subsequent violations)
Student may be assigned a Saturday School and a parent conference may and/or a hearing with the Education Committee of the Board of Trustees may be scheduled.

Students will be allowed to go home to change only with specific parent permission at that time, regardless of senior release status.  Time out of class for referral, in-house correction of dress situation, waiting for parents to bring appropriate clothing or during the time the student may be dismissed to go home to change will count as class absences.","modest/modesty, appropriate/inappropriate, disruption/distraction, interfere with learning, neat, clean",,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"dresses, skirts, shorts","""short""/""inappropriate length"" (no exact measurement given)",,,,none,,,"athletic pants:NA, sweat pants:NA",none,,,,none,,,,,,,none,halter dresses:NA,,,,,,,,,,,,"less than x fingers (insert amount in other), 3",un-hemmed sleeves:NA,,,none,,,none,,,,none,,,none,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,,,"religious, medical",,,,,,none,,,none,none,,,,none,,,,,,,"gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, discriminatory, weapons, sexual innuendo, threatening, social injustice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,none,,,,none,,,,,,,"1st Offense, 2nd, 3rd",,"2nd, 3rd",,,"1st Offense, 2nd, 3rd",3rd,,,,,"sent to guidance counselor:Any, parent conference:3rd",no,,

When in the judgment of the principal, the student's appearance, mode of dress, and/or cleanliness is
distracting and disruptive to the educational process, or constitutes a threat to safety of acceptable
standards of sanitation, or does not meet the following regulations, the student will be required to
make requested modifications. If the student must go home to meet the requirements, the absence
will be counted as one of their absences for the semester and a parent/administrator conference will
be required.
To implement the above policy, the following regulations have been adopted:
1. Shorts, skorts, skirts, and dresses will not be acceptable when it is determined that they are
inappropriate due to fit and/or length. Shorts, skirts, skorts, and dresses will be no more than
two inches above the top of the kneecap. No nylon or spandex shorts or leotards shall be
worn without a garment over them, determined to be acceptable.
 2. Sagging of the pants will not be allowed.
 3. Excessively Baggy pants will not be allowed. Administration will determine appropriateness of
 fit.
 4. Shoes must be worn at all times.
 5. Hats, caps, sunglasses, or similar articles will not be worn in the building.
 6. The wearing of any type of upper, outer body garment determined to be in poor taste because 
 of brevity of neck-line, cut of the arm-hole, or type of material will not be permitted. No midriff
 garments will be permitted. (Example: No strapless, see-through, or low-cut garments, or
 spaghetti straps.)
 7. Garments will not be worn that are determined to be unacceptable because of slogans or art
 work, particularly those that depict drugs, alcohol, tobacco, the occult, gang activity, or things
 of an obscene nature (example, playboy bunny logo).
 8. NO student shall wear nose rings or nose studs or any type of body piercing instruments with
 the exception of ear rings in the ears.
 *On certain occasions, a more stringent dress code may be enforced. For example, shorts will
 not be acceptable at special events such as graduation, awards ceremonies, installations, or
 other events so determined by the administration and/or activity sponsors. Students who
 choose to ignore this code may not be allowed to participate in the ceremony.

Appearance or dress may be a controversial matter as fashion changes in society. It is
the district’s position that since a student is spending a limited amount of time on campus they
should abide by the dress code restrictions they are asked to follow. The district acknowledges
that the dress requirements may be somewhat subjective; however, it is felt they are
reasonable requests. Students are encouraged to talk with school officials if they aren’t sure
whether a certain clothing item is appropriate so school administration may make the
necessary decision regarding questionable apparel.
It is the intent of the K-12 Dress Code to make all students and their parents/guardians
aware of what is considered suitable for an appropriate learning environment. We are aware
that some items listed are associated with teenage fads that do not necessarily affect younger
students. Discretion will be used in determining appropriate dress for different age groups.
REPEATED VIOLATIONS OF THE DRESS CODE SHALL RESULT IN APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY
ACTION BEING TAKEN.

any way to the disruption of the school, the student will be asked to change (with no further
consequences unless a situation is escalated by the student’s refusal to change). The dress
code is to be followed at all times including extra-curricular activities (dances, field trips, etc.).
The following guidelines will help parents/guardians and students interpret the dress policy.
A. Health and safety:
 Hats, hoods, visors, headbands, or hair should not obstruct vision or in any
way hinder or endanger students in school activities or classes.
 A student's person and clothing should be clean.
 Clothing should be appropriate to the weather and temperature of the
building. 
 Footwear adequate to protect the feet from injury should be worn at all times
(bare and stocking feet are prohibited).
 Sunglasses should not be worn.
B. Attire/grooming potentially disruptive to the educational process:
 Extremely short, loose, or tight clothing such that the undergarments or body
may be exposed; see-through or transparent clothing.
 Sexually explicit pictures, offensive language or images, or messages
promoting violence, drugs, tobacco, vaping, or alcohol.
 Wallet chains or studded accessories; noisy jewelry.
 Hats, hoods, visors, headbands, or other head coverings may be worn in the
school building, but must be removed without question at the request of a
member of staff if they pose a hindrance or danger in school activities.
Because of the nature of certain school activities, the school reserves the right to specify the
proper attire. These activities include dances, trips by school groups, and activities outside the
regular curriculum, including athletic trips. The principal or his/her designee has the authority to
interpret and enforce the policy statement on school dress.","health, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, interfere with learning, neat, clean, orderly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,,stocking feet:NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,obstructs vision:NA,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,none,dirty:NA,"alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, offensive, vaping",,,,,,,none,,,,,,,dirty body:NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Any,,,,,,,,,,,,yes," The principal or his/her designee has the authority to

be expected to cause disruption of or interference with normal operations. Any apparel or
grooming that is extreme, distracting, unsafe, gang-related, offensive, or threatening may be

student’s dress and grooming, the decision of the building principal is final and cannot be

or their designees, shall assist families in financial need to obtain clothing that complies with the school dress code. In meeting
requests for assistance, principals, or their designees, shall consider community resources such as clothing donations from school
personnel, merchants, parent organizations, and charitable organizations, financial assistance, and providing additional time for a
student to obtain clothing that complies with the school dress code.
Penalties/Sanctions: Students who elect not to conform to the dress and grooming rules will be given the opportunity to conform to
the dress code. Those students who do not have appropriate clothing at school will be sent home; an unexcused absence will be
assigned for the time it takes the student to return. Students must serve detention time in compliance with the unexcused absence
rule, which is double the time a student misses due to the unexcused absence.
Unusual Circumstances: If any unusual situation relative to dress or grooming arises which is not specifically covered in this policy,
the building administrator shall have the authority to decide if it fits within school appropriateness.
The dress code is in effect throughout the entire school year, INCLUDING semester test days. Students not meeting the dress
code on semester test days may be sent home, impacting the students ability to take a semester test, and resulting in a lower
grade for the course.","modest/modesty, health, safe/safety, interfere with learning, reasonable, good personal hygiene",,none,none,,none,,none,,,,,,,none,,,none,,"unfastened belts:NA, scarves:NA","skirts, shorts","shorter than fingertips, shorter than x inches from knee (insert amount in other), 6, whichever is longest",none,,none,,,,unzipped:NA,,,,,,,,none,none,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,none,,,"less than x fingers (insert amount in other), 2","unbuttoned:NA, unzipped:NA",,,,none,,none,none,,,none,,,,,,none,,,none,,none,,,,,,,,"religious, medical",,none,,,,,,none,none,none,,,,,,,,,,"dirty:NA, bad repair:NA","gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, vulgarity/profanity, death, sexually explicit, sexually suggestive, double meaning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,none,,,,,,,Any,,Any,,,,Any,,,,,,yes,"If the garments are immodest, even if they do not

is not acceptable, and what may or may not be disruptive. Again, the primary reason for
the School District of Wausaukee’s dress code is to foster an atmosphere conducive to
learning for all our students. Students are encouraged to ask themselves the following
questions when choosing what to wear to school:
● Does my outfit promote modesty and respectability?
● Does my choice of clothing make those around me uncomfortable?
● Does my clothing expose too much?
● Does my clothing advertise something that is prohibited to minors?
● Are there obscene, profane, drug-related, gang-related, or inflammatory
messages on my clothing?
● Am I dressed appropriately for the weather?
With the mixed messages in the media today, it is sometimes difficult for students to
objectively judge the appropriateness of clothing items. Therefore, it is up to
parents/guardians and school staff to be an advocate for every student in this regard.
If a student has selected a manner of appearance that is beyond mere freedom of
expression, disrupts the educational process, presents a risk to themselves or others,
and/or causes disruption among students and/or staff, he/she will need to find something
more appropriate to wear.","There are three fundamental reasons for a school dress code:
✓ to ensure the health and safety of all students,
✓ to prevent disruptions to the learning environment, and
✓ to encourage students in appropriate dress habits so they are prepared for the
professional world beyond high school and college.

grooming standards, if they comply with the following:
GROOMING
Hair is to be neat, clean, well‐groomed and styled so that vision will not be obstructed.
Disruptive hairstyles will not be permitted. Mustaches and beards will be kept neatly trimmed,
clean and will not be excessive in nature.
DRESS
Shoes or sandals must be worn at all times. No steel‐toed shoes/boots, roller‐shoes, or house

Leggings are acceptable if worn under clothing that meets the dress code.
Shirts should overlap the waistband of skirts, shorts, or pants. If the shirttail comes above the
waistband when both arms are raised, then the shirt will be considered inappropriate, unless an
underlayer of clothing is being worn in combination with the shirt. Entire midriff must be covered
whether sitting or standing.
Sleeveless tops, tank tops, tube tops, halter tops/blouses, mesh shirts, extremely tight,
and spaghetti strap clothing shall not be worn to school.
Low cut blouses or shirts will not be permitted. Undergarments, including bra straps and sports
bras, are not to be visible. All layered clothing combinations must meet dress code.

Pants/Jeans must be worn at waist level. A belt will be required if a student is unable to keep
them from falling below waist.
THE FOLLOWING SHALL NOT BE WORN TO SCHOOL:
• Sunglasses or gloves worn in the buildings
• Visible body jewelry other than earrings. One stud or dime sized hoop may be
worn in each ear by male students.

cooperation of each student is requested. Students are expected to abide by these
guidelines. Failure to comply with these guidelines will result in disciplinary action.
Initial judgment as to appropriateness will be made by the teacher, with final judgment
made by the principal.

considered offensively revealing or distasteful.
• Headgear in the school building is prohibited. i.e.: (caps, head covers, bandanas,
sunglasses, etc.). Hair bands that are an inch or under will be acceptable.
• Undergarments and shoes are required. However, undergarments should be fully
covered including bra straps and waistbands and tops of ""boxers."" At no time should
undergarments be showing through holes or tears in jeans/shirts or below the length
of a skirt / shorts, etc. Slippers and Pajama pants are not allowed.
• Bare midriff, see-through and backless garments are not appropriate nor are tops
tied together by strings across the back or around the neck such as the ""bandana"" or
""halter"" tied tops. ""Muscle Shirts' (for either boys or girls), tube tops, tops with straps
that do not cover the bra strap are not appropriate, as in ""spaghetti straps."" Tank
tops are acceptable if the depth of the armhole does not reveal undergarments or
allow the chest and back to be visible through the armhole. Shorts/skirts should not
be shorter than the longest finger tip of the student's hand when the arms are
hanging at the student's side.
A good guideline is to dress in a manner that would be acceptable in the 'professional' and
'craft' job settings. Any other type of dress may be questioned and consequences assigned
as listed in the ""Discipline"" section of this handbook.
A teacher may require additional standards of student dress as deemed appropriate in order
to insure a proper safety standard for the coursework/activities required in the class (i.e.
science, vocational classes, P.E. and any special project, etc.). This may extend to footwear,
fabric content requirements, head coverings, safety protection, etc. Failure to comply with
these requirements may result in disciplinary action under the ""Dress Code"" policy as well as
possible loss of points or credit for any work that a student may be unable to complete as a
result of non-compliance with the regulation.
Regarding graduation ceremonies, graduates are expected to abide by the grooming and
dress recommendations in order to participate in the ceremony. The pride the community
takes in its graduates should appropriately be reflected in the dress of those wishing to
participate. Specifics will be forwarded during the spring of the year. Questions in advance
may be directed to the principal.

Accordingly, the Superintendent shall establish such grooming guidelines as are necessary to promote discipline, maintain order,
secure the safety of students, and provide a healthy environment conducive to academic purposes. Such guidelines shall prohibit
student dress or grooming practices which:
A. present a hazard to the health or safety of the student himself/herself or to others in the school;
B. interfere with school work, create disorder, or disrupt the educational program;
C. cause excessive wear or damage to school property;
D. prevent the student from achieving his/her own educational objectives because of blocked vision or restricted movement.
Students who violate the foregoing rules will not be admitted to class and may be suspended from school.
Student dress is a factor in the establishment of an educational atmosphere and clothing should be appropriate for school.
Standards of dress which clearly deal with health and safety of students will be upheld (i.e., profanity or vulgar suggestions are not
permissible on clothing). Because some individuals or groups are representing the school, such as performing music groups,
athletic squads, cheerleaders, etc., the school reserves the right to establish more definitive dress policies for performing and
representative groups A. Students should dress in a common sense manner.
1. Students are expected to consider their school grooming and dress patterns to complement their education and
be conducive to learning and working environment.
2. No student will be allowed to attend school if his/her personal hygiene or wearing apparel endangers his own
health or safety, or the health and/or safety of others, or interferes in any way with anyone's right to an
education.
3. The final decision on any case will rest with the building principal.
B. The following is a list of unacceptable attire for school:

• All students must wear clothing that extends from the neck area to the shoulders. Any clothing that is not in
good taste and exposes undergarments or excessive amounts of flesh is not acceptable. Determination of
inappropriate clothing will be at the discretion of an administrator or his/her designee.
• Girls are not to wear halters. No students are allowed to wear tops that allow the exposure of the midriff or
cleavage as measured by using the collarbone measurement. (Collarbone measurement is no more than a
hand width (sideways) from the base of the neck to the top of the shirt.)
• Student dress (including accessories) may not advertise, promote, or depict alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs,
drug paraphernalia, violent behavior, or other inappropriate images.
• Student dress (including accessories) may not display lewd, vulgar, obscene, or offensive language or symbols,
including gang symbols.
• Hats, coats, bandanas, sweat bands, the hood for a hooded sweatshirt, and sun glasses may not be worn in the
building during the school day.
• Hair styles, dress, and accessories that pose a safety hazard are not permitted in the laboratories, or during
physical education. (Hats may be worn on designated hat days).
• Clothing with holes, rips or tears above mid-thigh, and clothing that is otherwise poorly fitting, showing skin
and/or undergarments may not be worn at school.
• The length of shorts or skirts must be appropriate for the school environment (mid-thigh). Shorts must have
hems.

Athletic shorts must cover mid-thigh to knee. (Spandex or frayed hem shorts will not be allowed).

• Running tights, yoga pants, leggings, may be worn if they are under clothing that is, itself, proper to wear. This
would include that proper clothing would cover from shoulders to mid-thigh. Pajama pants are not appropriate
dress for school, but may be worn on designated pajama days.
• Appropriate footwear must be worn at all times. (slippers are not appropriate footwear, but may be worn on
pajama days)

Clothing should conform to expectations and standards of safety as well as follow the Code of Virginia.
1. Clothing, jewelry, and accessories should not:
 Have language or images that are vulgar, discriminatory, or obscene
 Advocate or promote illegal or violent conduct, including but not limited to the
unlawful use of weapons, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or drug paraphernalia
 Represent gang affiliation, membership, or activity
 Reflect adversely on any person due to race, gender, sexuality, creed, national origin, or
physical, emotional, or intellectual abilities
 Have the potential to be used as a weapon
2. Clothing must cover private parts, midriff, breasts and the back below the top of shoulder blades
to base of the buttocks. Clothing must cover private parts from the base of the midriff and lower

back to the middle of the thigh as measured from the groin to the middle of the knee. Any ex-
posed area referred to in the aforementioned sentences is considered private for all genders.

3. Compression shorts, tights, and leggings of any type should be covered following guideline #2.

4. Clothing must cover all undergarments. This includes sagging or low-cut pants or low-cut neck-
lines.

5. See-through material does not constitute covering the skin, material must be opaque.
6. Tops should be secured in place over the shoulders in such a way as to prevent any private parts
from potentially being exposed by the top falling or being pulled down.
7. All outerwear covering inappropriate clothing as part of an outfit must be worn at all times.
8. Shoes must be worn at all times. All shoes must have sufficient soles to properly protect the feet
from injury (bedroom slippers typically do not have sufficient soles).
9. Hats may be worn in the building but should be taken off during instructional time.
10. Sunglasses are not to be worn in the building.
11. Individual teachers may have more stringent dress requirements for safety reasons within his/her
classroom. Students will be expected to follow said requirements while participating in said
class.

Students are expected to be able to engage in mutually respectful dialogue regarding controversial

issues. Every student has the right to freedom of speech and dress is an important form of ex-
pression. In the event clothing, jewelry, or accessories are worn that result in a disruption of the

educational environment such that students are deprived of their right to education, said articles
of clothing, jewelry, or accessories will be prohibited due to the proven potential for disruption.

Parents of students requiring accommodation for religious beliefs, disabilities, or health con-
cerns should contact the principal. These guidelines should be used to guide student attire at all

times while on school grounds or participating in school-related activities off grounds.

Violations of Dress Code Guidelines
1. Students noted to be violating these guidelines of dress will be asked to correct the violation. No
further action will be taken if student complies.
2. If student is unable to correct the violation on his/her own, the student will be sent to the office
to acquire appropriate clothing from the clothing stocked there for this purpose. No further action
will be taken if student complies.
3. If the student refuses to correct the violation, he/she will be sent to the office for dress guideline

evaluation by the principal(s). If the student is still found to be in violation, he/she will be given an-
other opportunity to correct the violation with his/her own clothing or by choosing something from

the clothing stocked in the office.
4. If the student continues to refuse to correct the violation, the student’s parent/guardian will be
contacted and asked to bring appropriate clothing for the student or arrange transportation for the
student to change into appropriate attire. Student will receive a lunch detention and class time
missed due to leaving school to change clothing or while waiting for clothing to be delivered will
not be excused.

5. If a student acquires more than 3 lunch detentions for violating dress guidelines within a semes-
ter, he/she will receive ISS. The second ISS received for violating dress guidelines will require a

parent/guardian to meet with the principal. Continued infractions will be considered a disciplinary
problem and student will be subject to NCPS disciplinary plan.","appropriate/inappropriate, safe/safety, professional/business",,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,,none,none,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,none,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,none,,,,,,,"gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, vulgarity/profanity, discriminatory, obscene, weapons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,none,,,,,none,,,,,,,Any,,,Any,Any,Any,Any,,,Any,Any,lunch detention:Any,no,,private parts

Parents and students are encouraged to address and resolve concerns related to the Dress & Grooming Policy at the campus level. The principal will assess and determine compliance or non-compliance with the Dress & Grooming Policy and assign corresponding consequences for violation of this policy.  The district’s dress code is established to teach grooming and hygiene, prevent disruptions and minimize safety hazards. After receiving community input and Board approval, some campuses have implemented standardized dress or school uniforms for their students. Campuses with standardized dress or school uniforms will provide specific information to parents related to their clothing requirements.

Parent and Student Responsibility
The parent and student shall be responsible for ensuring that the student is in compliance with all aspects of this policy during the time the student is on school premises during regular school hours. Items worn in violation of this policy may be taken up by a school official and returned according to campus policy Failure by the student to correct dress or grooming violations at first request is considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary action.

Policy Enforcement
It is the responsibility of all professional personnel to administer dress and grooming guidelines. Judgment, with consistent, fair and equitable enforcement of standards, while protecting the dignity of individual students, shall be practiced. Individual campuses may provide specific campus guidelines regarding dress and grooming for their students.

Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD reserves the right to establish rules during the school year regarding new fashions in dress and grooming. Students shall not wear any clothing that, in the principal’s judgment, is startling, unusual, disruptive, and immodest and/or brings undue attention to the student. Students shall not wear any item that is lewd, offensive, vulgar, obscene, or depicts nudity, violence, drugs or alcoholic  beverages. Clothes that raise questions as to whether the clothing item is within the policy may be prohibited. Students’ dress and grooming should not distract other students and/or staff and should contribute to a safe, positive learning environment.

Exclusions
This policy does not prohibit principals from allowing extracurricular group uniforms to be worn on days of special celebrations which involve unusual dress such as “crazy hat day or” 50’s day.

Students are not to dress in a way that presents a health or safety hazard, that constitutes harassment as defined in the district’s harassment policy, or that materially disrupts classwork, causes substantial disorder, or violates the rights of others while on school premises or at school-sponsored functions
Students will not be allowed to wear clothing which declares membership in a group that has as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal acts, or acts that would be criminal if the student were an adult.  For the purpose of this policy, a group is defined as an ongoing organization or association of three or more persons, whether formal or informal that has a common name or a common identifying sign or symbol; and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal activity, intimidation or recruitment of others for such activities.  It has been the experience of the Hudson School District that student dress which signifies or which is likely to be interpreted by other students as signifying membership in such groups calls undue attention to students, causes disruption, and serves to intimidate other students.
The following conditions or restrictions of student dress are subject to health, safety and disruption criteria that show a substantive or material impact on the school environment or individual welfare:  Students will wear clothes that are clean and are not a health risk.  They will dress in a way that does not endanger themselves or others and will wear clothing that covers their stomachs, chests, backs, buttocks and undergarments. Students are required to wear footwear. Shoulder straps are required on all tops.  Students will not wear clothing that is obscene (including obscene items “with double meaning”.)
PROHIBITED ITEMS INCLUDE: Students will not wear clothing that defames, insults, threatens, distracts, harasses or injures any racial or cultural groups or individuals.  Students will not wear clothing that depicts, promotes, or advertises violence, drugs, sex or sexual activity, criminal behavior, or tobacco or nicotine products (including electronic cigarettes).   
In accordance with this policy, building level rules and developmentally appropriate standards will be established and reviewed periodically.  Students, staff and parents shall be informed and educated about the dress code at each of the Hudson School District buildings.
Monitoring and enforcement of the dress code policy will be done in a non-discriminatory way and will not restrict rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.  Monitoring and enforcement of the dress code policy is the responsibility of all school employees.  Disciplinary action associated with the dress code policy is subject to due process and is the responsibility of building administration. Students will be expected to change clothing if found to be out of compliance with the Dress Code.

that the school community is more sensitive than the general population. We believe it is important for the home and school
to encourage desirable characteristics of student dress. A student’s wardrobe should be conducive to sitting in desks, getting
up and down, bending, and kneeling. Clothing should be neat, clean, inoffensive, decent, and offer protection for all
classroom activities while at Morenci High School. In order to clarify what is considered appropriate, the following has been
developed with faculty and student input:
Shirts / Tops
 Shirt and tank top straps must be approximately 1½” in width or wider.
 No undergarments may be showing at any time (including bra straps); tank tops that abide by the strap width
requirements will not be considered undergarments.
 Sleeveless Shirt underarm openings will be no lower than approximately 3” below the arm pit.
 No strapless, spaghetti straps, tube tops, halter tops, sheer or see-through, backless, one shoulder or off the
shoulder shirts may be worn (unless a garment with appropriate strap width is worn underneath).
 Shirts should not expose skin lower than the shoulder blades.
 Shirts must cover the complete midriff (front and back) when arms are raised.
 Shirts may not be excessively baggy or oversized for a student’s body type.
 Necklines of all tops must be modest (front and back); low-cut necklines are prohibited. Shirts must cover all
visible cleavage (when standing or sitting) and must appropriately cover the chest area (pictures have been
included to give examples of the maximum amount of skin that can be exposed).
Skirts / Dresses
 The tops/upper portion of any dress worn must abide by the requirements outlined in the Shirts/Tops category.
 When seated, skirts and dresses must be at mid-thigh or longer.
Shorts / Pants
 When standing, shorts must reach at least mid-thigh or lower (mid-thigh will be determined from the frontal
view of the bend in the upper leg to the knee.)
 Tops of shorts and pants must be worn at the hips or higher.
Accessories
 Bandanas are not allowed (defined as a large handkerchief).
 Sunglasses may be worn on top of the head as long as they do not become a classroom distraction.
 Headbands may be worn as long as they are worn around the head as intended (defined as an elastic band worn
around the head).
 No spiked jewelry or accessories will be allowed (including jewelry/accessories that can be used as a weapon).
 Shoes must be worn at all times. Defined by footwear having a hard or rubber sole (flip flops are allowed). 
29
 Belts worn with pants and shorts must be worn completely through the belt loops (no dangling ends).
 Hats, including beanies and hoods, are not to be worn in the building. (Exception includes the school
gymnasium and when handling consumables)
All Clothing / Accessories
 Anything worn that displays references to illegal or controlled actions/substances (including tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, drugs, and/or violence etc.) will not be allowed.
 Any combination of clothing which, upon guidance from law enforcement agencies, is considered gang related
(subject to change) i.e. bandanas, hair nets (unless handling consumables), metal belt buckles with gang
monograms, dangling belts, chain accessories, slippers, do-rags etc. is not allowed.
 Anything worn that displays sexually suggestive or provocative wording or images is not allowed (including
clothing and accessories containing the phrase, “I love boobies”).
 Anything worn which displays symbols which reference hatred, hate crimes, violence, anti-social behaviors, or
that offend or intimidate is not allowed.
 Anything worn that has rips, tears, frays, or that is see-through or distressed may not expose any more than what
is outlined in the previous categories.
 Frayed pants or shorts cannot be present or visible above the mid-thigh area (teacher/administrator discretion
will be used to determine the appropriateness of dress).
*Dress code will be more lax during Homecoming weeks, only if students are participating in the approved spirit days.
Limitations and requirements for skin exposure will not be changed.
*During Prom/Dances, the dress code will be more lax; clothes must be conducive to dancing. Dress code will be monitored
by the dance chaperones.
Clothing considered inappropriate but not defined by policy or regulation will be dealt with on an individual basis by the
administration. The dress code may be altered as determined necessary by the administration. Administration will provide
clothing the student is able to change into. If a student refuses to change, the student will be admitted to OCS the same day
and additional consequences may be administered.
Consequences for inappropriate dress:
 1st offense - Warning, not allowed to attend class until properly clothed. Student may call home. Hats will be
confiscated.
 2nd offense - Assigned to OCS for the remainder of the day.
 Repeated offenses - Continue progressive discipline. See Disciplinary Actions
Coaches and club sponsors have authority to impose a dress code for trips and other functions unique to their club. It
is not the intention of Morenci High School to strictly enforce the dress code at formal dances because we recognize that
formal dresses are often strapless or have spaghetti straps. If the dress appropriately covers the body and is not in poor taste,
it will be permissible at formal dances. The administrator and the sponsors who chaperone the dance will be responsible for
making this determination. The dress code will be enforced at all other after school functions. Students not in compliance will
be asked to leave and will be subject to the same disciplinary measures that apply to the regular school day. (Policies JICA,

classes. Student attire should be neat and clean. School Board Policy #51 32 prohibits the wearing of
clothing and/or adornment that advertises alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, controlled substances,
or gang activity. Such attire and/or activity can be potentially life-threatening and is prohibited on
school grounds and at school activities on and off campus. The policy further prohibits the presence of
any apparel including jewelry, accessory, notebook, or manner of grooming which by virtue of its color,
arrangement, trademark, or any other attribute denotes membership in a gang or group. Also
prohibited is the carrying of gang paraphernalia or making gestures that symbolize gang membership.
A gang is defined as an association of students, not curriculum-related or organized for the purpose of
the furtherance of some political, religious, moral, environmental, artistic, athletic, musical, or a sociallyresponsible
goal.
Avoidance of distracting influences is the key to an appropriate appearance. Any apparel, cosmetic

black. School approved baseball caps and beanies are permitted, with a Weston Ranch High
logo (without other added design or writing). Baseball caps must be worn in such a manner as to
provide protection from the sun facing forward. All hats and beanies may only be worn while
outside the school buildings. Solid color beanies, without any logo may be worn for protection
against cold weather in white, off-white, tan, gray, black, or maroon. Staff will take away hats
from students wearing them in an inappropriate manner and disciplinary action may follow.

Research has shown that there is a direct correlation between student dress and student behavior.
Students must be neat, clean and properly dressed. No student will be permitted to wear clothing that
creates a disturbance to the learning environment. Students who choose to dress inappropriately will be
subject to disciplinary action.
The following are general guidelines to ensure that Riverdale High School students are appropriately
dressed for school. Specific questions should be addressed to an assistant principal.
 Shoes shall be worn at all times. Slippers are not appropriate footwear for school.
 Apparel shall be adequate in both length and coverage to be considered appropriate for school.
Short-shorts, “Daisy Dukes”, etc. are not acceptable.
 Pants shall be worn fastened at the waist.
 Shirts or blouses shall be appropriately fastened in accordance with the design of that shirt or
blouse. The length shall extend beyond waist level.
 Transparent or see-through tops, bare midriff, strapless, low-cut clothing or tops and outfits that
provide minimum coverage or are of a suggestive nature are prohibited; halters, backless dresses
or tops, tube tops, spaghetti strap, muscle shirts, or any clothing which may be distracting are
prohibited.
 Any articles of clothing or jewelry that could likely cause injury-such as chains, bracelets, rings,
chokers with or without spikes or studs are prohibited. Wallet chains of any length are
prohibited.
 Apparel, emblems, insignias, badges or symbols that promote the use of alcohol, drugs, tobacco,
firearms, or any other illegal activity are prohibited.
 Apparel, symbols, or any item, which may be gang-related, may not be displayed on a student’s
person or in the student’s possession.
 Adornments that, in the principal’s judgment could cause injury, be a safety risk, or cause a
disruption to the school environment may not be worn. Examples of prohibited adornments
include, but are not limited to, hoops or rings attached to the nose, eyebrow, cheeks or lips.
 Pajama bottoms or clothing of lycra or spandex may not be worn.
 The wearing on campus of hats, caps, headgear or sunglasses except in conjunction with
designated school-approved uniforms or at authorized athletic practices or activities is
prohibited. There may be exceptions for medical conditions and physical education classes held
outside. The principal will determine these exceptions. Clothing with slogans or advertising which by its controversial or obscene nature disrupts the
educational setting is prohibited.

educational setting. Examples of such clothing include, but are not limited to: See-through clothing, visible
undergarments, oversized pants that expose undergarments, pajamas, garments that provoke or distract
students or school employees, that are obscene, vulgar or demeaning. Examples are: suggestive symbols,
behavior, apparel, or paraphernalia that link groups to gangs or any antisocial behavior. Cover-up clothing
(jackets, coats, sweaters, etc.) worn over such apparel may also be deemed unacceptable. A good
guideline for appropriate shorts/skirts length is past the fingertips when arms are extended down; however,
staff may still determine the item inappropriate for school.
2. Students are required to wear shoes or footwear with soles, dress appropriate for the seasons and refrain
from excessive writing on body skin with pens, ink or other materials.
3. District policy promotes a drug free environment in the school setting. Tee shirts and other garments,
buttons, patches, and accessories, which advocate the use of illegal drugs and alcohol, are prohibited.
4. Any clothing that exposes bare skin (as described below) may not be worn. Such clothing that exposes
bare skin is distracting in a school setting. Clothing that is distracting, may include, but not be limited too,
items such as see-through garments, halters, backless dresses or tops, tube tops, bare midriff tops, short
shorts or short skirts, etc. Cover-up clothing such as jackets, coats, sweaters, worn over such apparel may
also be deemed inappropriate for school. Exposed cleavage is not acceptable.
5. All dress is subject to staff discretion.
If a student violates the dress code, the student will be given the opportunity to correct their attire or style of hair
that school day. Corrections will be made by making immediate adjustments at school, wearing a school district
garment, or going home to change. Parents may be contacted. A student who continues to violate the dress code

if necessary, waive these policy restrictions in religious and/or medical situations. Students who represent
their school in an official capacity are expected to abide by the dress code established by the

It is not the intention of this policy to list every possible clothing item. Students are to maintain an appearance,

considered unacceptable when it attracts undue attention to the individual or health and safety becomes a
concern.

faculty and administration. The consequences when a student does not comply with this policy are:

 Second Offense – the parent will be called by an administrator and asked to pick up their child so they
can change or drop off a change of clothes so the student can change. The student will also receive one

minimize safety hazards. Students and parents may determine a student’s personal dress and
grooming standards, provided that they comply with the following:
Philosophy
One of Tarkington I.S.D.’s goals for ALL students is that they succeed both academically and
socially and are prepared for the future after they graduate from high school. It is the
philosophy of Tarkington I.S.D. that one’s behavior, actions, and performance are affected by
the way people dress. Appropriate student dress and grooming are important factors in the
orderly operation of the schools. In the future, one certainly will have to follow rules,
regulations, and dress codes of employers and some institutions of higher learning. Therefore,
full cooperation between the home and school is expected.
Violation of the dress code is a Level II offense, according to The Student Code of Conduct.
Additional disciplinary action other than those listed in this policy may be imposed. Failure to
comply with the District’s dress and grooming standards will result in disciplinary action.
This dress code has been established to:
 Reflect the high standards of the community, adhering to good taste, modesty, and
dignity;
 Create an atmosphere of respect for authority, safety, and good personal
hygiene/grooming;
 Promote consistent standards of dress and grooming; and
 Reflect a sense of pride in self, one’s academic achievements, one’s school, and the
District.
The student and his/her parent(s) or guardian may determine the student’s personal dress and
grooming standards provided that the student’s dress and grooming:
 Shall not lead school officials to reasonably believe that such dress or grooming will
disrupt, interfere with, disturb, or detract from school activities; and
 Shall not create a health problem or safety hazard for the student or others.
Using the following guidelines, school administrators, with the input and support of faculty
members, have the final decision in determining and enforcing acceptable student dress and
grooming standards. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically to ensure that they continue
to address the standards of the community and District.
General Guidelines
 Students are not to wear clothing that is tight, loose, revealing, saggy, or short.
Examples of unacceptable clothing according to this guideline include biker shorts,
miniskirts, tank tops, backless apparel, midriffs, see-through clothing, and/or
deliberately cut or torn garments.
 Students are prohibited from wearing clothing with visual, written, or implied messages
that are likely to disrupt the school environment. Examples of such prohibited visual,
written, or implied messages include, but are not limited to, the following: drugs,
alcohol, tobacco, weapons, violence, vulgar or obscene language, and/or insults to race,
religion, gender, or ethnicity. All flags or facsimiles thereof may not be attached on a
garment/jewelry/item in a disrespectful manner.
 Students are prohibited from wearing any form of dress or accessory identifying him or
her with a gang, cult, or other unauthorized student group or symbolizing the beliefs of
such a group.
 Students must wear appropriate underclothing.
 Students may not wear pajama tops or bottoms.
 Students participating in school-related activities, such as extracurricular or UIL

minimize safety hazards.","The district’s dress code is established to teach grooming and hygiene, prevent disruption, and
minimize safety hazards. Students and parents may determine a student’s personal dress and
grooming standards, provided that they comply with the following:
 We take pride in Rogers I.S.D. and its traditions. One of the most important ways of
doing this is for each one of us to reflect careful and consistent personal habits and
appearance each day. We seek to avoid the fads that are not in keeping with good
grooming. In addition, hairstyles and certain manners of dress that might present a danger to
the student’s health and safety, cause an interference with school work, or create classroom
or school disruption, will not be tolerated. The dress code is in effect for all students when
they are representing the school at any function.
 1. Slogans, pictures, or advertisements, which could disrupt the learning atmosphere,
are not permitted. These include but are not limited to obscene slogans or pictures and
advertisements for alcohol and/or drug related items or products and tobacco products. Any
apparel considered gang related or gothic related will not be allowed.
 2. Shirts and blouses shall be appropriately sized. No skin shall be visible between the
shirt/top and pants, skirts, or shorts while standing, sitting, or bending. Spaghetti straps, low
necklines, halter-tops, crop tops, backless, strapless, fishnet and midriff tops are not
acceptable. Tank tops must be 3 fingers in width at the shoulder top. Shirts, blouses and
sweaters may be sleeveless, but the armhole must be small enough to not reveal any part of
the chest, torso, or underwear.
 3. For grades 6-12-skirts, dresses, or shorts must be 2 inches from the top of the knee or
longer while standing straight with arms and hands parallel to the body. The slit in dresses
must adhere to these guidelines as well. For grades PK-5-dresses, skirts, and shorts that
reach the fingertips, with arms held normally at the side, are acceptable.
 4. Pants, slacks and jeans are permitted, but must fit at the waist, crotch and legs. Pants
that are baggy may not be worn. No sagging will be allowed. Pants, jeans, capris and shorts
may not have any holes above 2 inches from the top of the knee. Pajama style pants will not
be permitted. Appropriate clothing must be worn over tight fitting clothing. Students may
not fix dress code issues with tape or by wearing tights.
 5. All clothes including overalls shall be buttoned appropriately, and belts shall be
buckled. Dangling ends on suspenders, or belts or overalls are not permitted. The waistline
of all clothing must be worn at the waistline of the student. A belt must be used if clothing

manner on or above the waist. To properly identify the individual to whom the badge belongs, the badge
should clearly identify the campus name, student name, student photo, and barcode.
In order to maintain a safe and orderly environment, all students shall be required to meet the minimum
expectations of the dress and grooming code. Wearing apparel that unduly attracts the attention of other students
often precipitates comments and/or other reactions that are disruptive. Safety, general health, and hygiene are
factors that are also considered. The provisions of the dress and grooming code shall be enforced equally with
regard to all students to whom the provisions apply. Students are expected to comply with the dress code at any 
school-related event or activity; school officials have the authority to ask students to leave if they are
inappropriately dressed.
In addition to the goals outlined above, a good way for a student to reflect a positive attitude toward school and
education is to display proper dress and grooming. It is the responsibility of the parents and the students to ensure
that attire worn to school meets District requirements. This dress code is established to teach grooming and hygiene,
reduce loss of personal property, and teach respect for authority. It should promote the best possible environment
for learning. Disruptive dress and grooming cause distractions among students and teachers, disrupting the learning
atmosphere. Because of these and other factors, the student dress code will be enforced at all schools.
Northwest Independent School District encourages students to be clean and well-groomed at all times. The specific
criteria below is intended to assist parents with the student’s dress and grooming.
GENERAL CRITERIA
A student’s personal dress and grooming standards must adhere to the following criteria:
1. Shall not lead school officials to reasonably believe that such dress or grooming will disrupt, interfere with,
disturb, or detract from school activities.

having to have two pairs of shoes at school. b) If students wear other shoes, they must not have
metal tips or wheels. c) For safety, sandals must have a strap on the heel.
7. Shall not have inappropriate hairstyles that cause a disruption.
8. Shall not include sagging pants, trousers, or shorts that cause an abnormal gait or reveal underwear (must be
worn at normal waist level). Pants must fit properly and must fit at the waist. Pants may not be oversized. Pants

students’ jumpers or dresses must be worn with shirts or blouses underneath.

“holey” above mid-thigh; tank tops that are not at least as wide as the shortest side (approximately 2”) of a
student ID; spaghetti straps; cut-off T-shirts or clothing revealing shoulders; “low cut” tops; shirts open at the
side; fishnet shirts; tube tops; or sheer or see-through clothing of any kind. Proper undergarments must be
worn and covered by outer clothing.
11. Shall not wear clothing normally considered pajamas.
12. Shall not wear chains (including those attached to pants or billfolds), cords, ropes, or others items which
could be used as weapons or are deemed a safety or health hazard.
For special events, defined by campus administration, specific dress requirements may be set. When there is
a question on the dress or appearance of a student, the building administrator and school staff will use their
discretion concerning the dress code. Students must honor the decision of the administrator in charge and
make any dress and/or grooming change required. The student and/or his or her parents may then appeal
the decision to the Superintendent or designee if they disagree with the decision.
If school administrators determine that revisions in the dress and grooming standards are necessary in order to avoid
interference in the educational process, they may make such changes with proper notification to students and parents.
Students will be required to change clothing to comply with the dress code if they arrive with inappropriate dress
for school. Those who refuse to or cannot comply may be asked to return home or spend the remainder of the day
in the special assignment classroom.

These guidelines must be followed:
What should be covered…
• Clothing that is revealing or displays underwear or the torso is not allowed.
• Clothing should cover and extend half way between the knee and beltline.
• Bandanas are not permitted. Hats are permitted in all common areas, but are at teacher discretion in the classroom.
• Sunglasses are not permitted indoors. Any exception must have medical documentation on record in the office. Clothing should not be worn that is marked or decorated with illustrations of tobacco; alcohol; drugs; sexual
innuendo; word or phrases that are vulgar or obscene or promote behaviors that violate school conduct standards.
This can include “gang” colors or identifying clothing (i.e. ICP garments) if the students are acting in ways that
display a gang mentality. 
• Spiked jewelry, chains and spiked belts are not allowed. Belts must not hang down.
We ask that parents support this process. Students violating the dress code will be required to obtain a change of
clothes from home or wear a shirt provided by the school. Students will also be issued an on-line discipline

governing student dress and grooming which are consistent with District policy and regulations. These school dress
codes shall be regularly reviewed.
The following procedures, together with the basic policy, constitute the dress code for the schools:
 1. All school personnel working under the direction of the administration are responsible for providing an
atmosphere on school campuses which is conducive to proper behavior, attitudes, and learning.
 2. All students are expected to wear clothes that are clean, neat, properly fitted, and in good repair. Likewise, all
students are expected to be clean and neat in their grooming. The Board prohibits the presence of any apparel,
 jewelry, accessory, notebook or manner of grooming which, by virtue of its color, arrangement, trademark, or
any other attribute, denotes membership in gangs which advocate drug use, violence, or disruptive behavior.
3. Any manner of dress or grooming which presents a potentially disruptive influence in the school is to be
corrected.
4. Each school administration is to enforce suitable rules and regulations which affect the health and safety of
students in all activities, both instructional and co-curricular. Each school administration shall interpret what is
appropriate according to the rules set forth below.
5. Each school administration may establish more stringent rules for students participating in performing groups,
sports, and other situations where students represent the school in the community.
6. Variations from the basic dress code may be established for special events.
7. The following is a list of items to be used as guidelines in the determination of acceptable dress and grooming
for students.
Presenting a bodily appearance or wearing clothing which is disruptive, revealing, profane, vulgar, offensive or obscene,
or which endangers the health and safety of other students is prohibited. Examples of prohibited dress or appearance
include, but are not limited to:
● Attire that exposes cleavage
● Exposed undergarments/no proper undergarments
● Excessively sagging pants
● Excessively short or tight garments
● Bare midriff shirts/pants
● Strapless shirts
● Attire with messages or illustrations that are lewd, indecent or vulgar
● Attire that advertises products or services not permitted by law to minors
● See-through clothing
● Any adornment such as chains or spikes that could reasonably be perceived as a weapon
● Any symbol, style or attire frequently associated with gangs, intimidation, violence or violent groups
● Headgear of any kind may not be worn in buildings
● Shoes must be worn at all times
The following procedures are guidelines for implementing the policy and the code:
1. Teachers, counselors, or administrators are to make a reasonable attempt to counsel students whose grooming and/or
dress deviates from the dress code.
2. A student who is found to be in violation of the dress code may be sent home or may otherwise be required to
properly prepare himself/herself for school.
3. If the violations continue, contact is to be made with the parents/guardians by the school representative and the
parents/guardians are to be made aware of the failure of the student to conform to the rules and regulations of the
school.
4. Continued violation of the dress code constitutes willful disobedience and is good cause for disciplinary
consequences including detention, Saturday school, in-house suspension, suspension or expulsion from school.
Gang-Related Apparel​ 13
At individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the principal,
staff and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define “gang-related apparel”
and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health and safety of the
school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus. Because gang-related symbols are constantly
changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least once each semester and updated whenever related
information is received.

be safe, healthful, and not interfere with or distract from the educational process.
Personal Appearance
It is expected that students will come to school appropriately dressed. Examples of student apparel that are not
acceptable during school or school-related activities are the following:
1. Caps, hats, bandanas, and other types of ""outdoor"" clothing
2. Shirts or patches worn with obscene or double meaning slogans, sayings, or pictures
3. Shirts or patches that advertise alcohol, tobacco, or other banned substances
4. Halter tops, bare midriff styles or spaghetti straps. (Shirts should have at least 1” wide straps)
5. Apparel that reveals any portion of undergarments
6. Skirts and shorts that are less than the length of the extended arms (including fingers). Interior pockets
should not be visible below the hem.
7. Other items or apparel deemed improper. The principal is responsible for the interpretation of the above guidelines. If at any time student apparel is
judged to constitute a health or safety hazard, be disruptive of the educational process, or is contrary to community
standards and values, students will be asked to modify their appearance to an acceptable level.

If in doubt, don't wear it!

Parents are urged to monitor student dress and assist the child in making appropriate decisions. General cleanliness
of body and clothing is of the utmost importance. Studies show there is a direct relationship between the type of
clothing worn and the way children conduct themselves.
Iowa’s educational standards require that students from grades one through twelve be taught the effects of alcohol,
tobacco, drugs and poisons on the human body as part of their health and physical education. Any message
depicting the use of alcohol or drugs runs counter to our educational mission. While the primary responsibility for
appearance rests with the students and their parents, the administration reserves the right to judge what is proper
and what is not. Please carefully screen t-shirt communication. We stress the importance of communicating with
each other in a respectful manner and some t-shirts do not support that effort.
Students will not be allowed to wear any type of headgear (caps, hats, headbands, or bandanas) in educational areas
and the lunchroom. Students will be asked to promptly remove their headgear when they enter the building. Short
shirts that allow the exposure of the midriff in either boys or girls will not be allowed.","appropriate/inappropriate, health, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, interfere with learning, improper, community standards and values, clean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"skirts, shorts",shorter than fingertips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,visible pockets:NA,,,,,,,,none,,,,,none,,,,none,"less than x inches (insert amount in other), 1",,,,none,,,,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,none,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"outdoor clothing:NA, improper:NA, dirty:NA","alcohol, tobacco, obscene, double meaning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,dirty hair:NA,,,,,,,"female, male",,,,,,,Any,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,"While the primary responsibility for

Clothing that works well for the beach, yard work, dance clubs, exercise sessions, sleeping, and sports contests are not appropriate for an educational environment. Clothing that reveals cleavage, your back, your chest, your stomach or your underwear is not appropriate for the classroom and will not be tolerated.  Any clothing that has words, terms or pictures that may be offensive to other students or staff is unacceptable. Clothing that has the OHS school logo is encouraged.  School dress code applies to all activities before or after school hours where all or part of the expectation of your attendance is that you are representing OHS.  For example, all club, award, banquet and performance activities, and all public forums where you represent the school, such as school board and community organization presentations.
 
SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
All students must wear school issued lanyards with ID badges and must be visible by staff everyday as part of OHS dress code expectations.  
Wearing/carrying hats of any kind is not allowed on school property during the school day from 7:00 am to 3:30 pm.  Hats cannot be visible on campus during these hours. They will be taken and a parent must come and pick up in the office. They must be put away inside your bag.  Hoodies are allowed, but hoods are off in the building at all times.
Graphics and/or symbols on any personal item (to include clothing, backpacks, binders, body art, etc.) that any staff member deems as inappropriate, or disruptive to the learning environment, due to content, implied meaning, or gang/drug affiliation is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, sexual innuendos.  Rosaries may not be worn outside of clothing.
Clothing with Ontario High School logo is encouraged.  The “Straight Out of O-Town Logo” may not be worn.
All shirts must have sleeves.
Blankets cannot be worn or used on campus.
Professional sports team clothing (to include jackets, backpacks, lanyards, binders, etc.) is not allowed.  College team clothing is allowed.
The back, stomach, chest, and back side should be covered. Skin should not be visible even through clothing.  
Necklines cannot dip below the straight line made across the chest when crossing from the top of one armpit to the other.
All shorts, skirts, dresses, and tunics (long shirts) must come within enough inches from the knee that inappropriate exposure does not occur when bending over, squatting and/or sitting down - this will be at the final discretion of OSC and administrative staff, so please check this before leaving home.
All clothing must fit correctly.  No sagging, baggy or extremely tight clothing which includes leggings, yoga pants, and athletic wear unless worn under tunics, dresses, and skirts.
No holes or rips (even stylistically intentional, even with layers underneath) are allowed in pants, shorts or skirts.
No house slippers or pajamas (including bottoms) are allowed.
Ontario School District may provide religious exemptions in dress codes and/or uniform policies.
If clothing fails to meet standards as determined by OHS Staff, the student will be allowed to call home for a change of clothes and then return to the learning environment.  If the student incurs multiple dress code violations, progressive disciplinary action will be applied. 
 
IF DRESS CODE VIOLATION CANNOT BE FIXED PERMANENTLY AND IMMEDIATELY, STUDENTS ARE SENT TO THE OSC IMMEDIATELY.  THE OSC WILL CALL HOME FOR CLOTHING AND WHEN ISSUE IS RESOLVED, THE STUDENT WILL BE SENT BACK TO CLASS.  NOTE:  PUTTING A SWEATSHIRT ON OR ZIPPING A COAT UP IS NOT AN OPTION FOR PERMANENT RESOLUTION.

minimize safety hazards. Students and parents may determine a student’s personal dress and
grooming standards, provided that they comply with the district board approved dress code.
If the principal determines that a student’s grooming or clothing violates the school’s dress code,
the student will be given an opportunity to correct the problem at school. If not corrected, the
student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day, until the problem
is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of clothing to the school.

practices; and from wearing clothing displaying obscenity, profanity, vulgarity, racial or sexual remarks, making

code, the student will be given an opportunity to correct the problem at school. If not
corrected, the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day,
until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of

Wharton JH/HS has a dress and grooming code that is established to teach grooming and
hygiene, prevent disruptions, avoid safety hazards and teach respect for oneself and others.
Students should be dressed and groomed in a manner that is clean and neat, that will not be

impression for both the student and those around him or her. Given that school is the

and the proper way to interact with peers and persons of authority, they are expected to
dress in a way appropriate to that environment.
The staff of the school is authorized to enforce the district’s dress and grooming code. Final
determination of acceptable dress and grooming standards rests with the Principal and
his/her designee and cannot be appealed.

The Griffin-Spalding County School System dress code requires students in middle and high school to dress in a manner that is conductive to a good learning environment.  Our behavior patterns are affected by what we wear.  When students are wearing proper attire, they are more reserved in their behavior.  Visitors and our community judge our schools by the appearance and deportment of our students.  Our impressions upon others and the impressions of the entire school are influenced by what students wear.

One objective of a school is to assist students in preparing for life in the business and social worlds.  Our schools, therefore, should help students learn to dress in a manner the public finds appropriate.  Many fads in dress are not appropriate for school.  Therefore, students’ dress should reflect neatness, cleanliness and should not distract or cause disruption in the educational process of school.","The Griffin-Spalding County School System dress code requires students in middle and high school to dress in a manner that is conductive to a good learning environment.

Therefore, students’ dress should reflect neatness, cleanliness and should not distract or cause disruption in the educational process of school.

The school administration reserves the right to determine if a student’s dress, hairstyle, etc. are too casual, too revealing, or too distracting in the learning environment to be considered appropriate for school.  The safety of all students will be taken into consideration when making decisions regarding appropriate/inappropriate attire including the tucking in of shirt tails.

It is not the intent of this regulation to create hardship or stress on any student or parent, but rather to provide a reasonable standard of dress.  Recognizing the fact that no dress code is perfect and there may be some who will not agree on all points, we are requesting the cooperation of all students and their parents in adhering to this policy.  The following restrictions, therefore, are imposed:

During school hours or at school activities, students should wear appropriate footwear.   (Flip flops and bedroom shoes are not appropriate.)
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not wear clothing with slit(s) or hole(s).  (Frayed area(s) and patched holed are not appropriate.)
During school hours or at school activities, students may wear skirts, shorts, skorts, or dresses that fall below fingertip length when arms are held loosely at the side.
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not wear tank shirts, halter tops, shirts or dresses with spaghetti straps.   In addition, tops that expose cleavage, the midriffs, strapless dresses or see-through clothing are not appropriate during school hours or at school activities.
During school hours or at school activities, tails of shirts shall be worn at wrist level or above.  Shirts longer than this must be tucked. During school hours or at school activities, students shall wear pants belted at the natural waistline. There will be no “busting slack” or exposure of clothing designed and sold as undergarments during school hours.

If school personnel determine that a student’s grooming, or dress, violates the dress code,
that student shall be given an opportunity to correct the problem. Repeated offenses will
result in more serious disciplinary action. Appropriate discipline procedures shall be
followed in all cases.
The principal, in cooperation with the sponsor, coach, or other person in charge of an
extracurricular activity, may regulate the dress and grooming of students who participate
in the activity. Students who violate those standards may be removed or excluded from
the activity for a period determined by the principal or sponsor, and may be subject to
other disciplinary action.
If the principal determines that a student’s grooming or clothing violates the school’s
dress code, the student will be given an opportunity to correct the problem at school. If
not corrected, the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of
the day, until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable
change of clothing to the school. Repeated offenses may result in more serious
disciplinary action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct.","health, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, interfere with learning, teach grooming and hygiene, clean, neat, indecent, attract undue attention, proper decorum",,none,,,,,,,,,,none,,none,,none,,,"large dangling earrings:NA, dangling belts:NA","dresses, skirts, shorts","shorter than x inches from knee (insert amount in other), 3",,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"strapless dresses:female, spaghetti strap dresses:female",,,male,,,male,female,"female, male",female,,female,"less than x inches (insert amount in other), 3 (female only)",untucked shirts that extends past finger tips:NA,,none,,none,,none,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,none,,none,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,female,,,,,,female,none,,none,,none,"variance from community standards:NA, dirty:NA, excessive holes:NA, holes that expose skin:NA","gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, satanic, cult",,,male,,,,male,,"female, male",male,none,,none,"dirty hair:male, ungroomed hair:male, hair longer than the bottom of the ear:male, hair that touches the shirt collar in back:male, designs in the hair:male, ponytails:male, rat-tails:male, braids:male, beards:male, goatees:male, dirty:NA",,,,,,,female,,,,,,,Any,,,Any,,Any,,,,Any,,,yes,"The District prohibits any clothing or grooming that in the principal’s

other areas of the body that expose too much bare skin.
● Jackets and backpacks must be placed in student lockers and remain in lockers until the end of

The use of common sense in the matter of personal grooming and wearing of clothing is the best criteria to
follow. Cedar Grove-Belgium requests that all parents/guardians take an active interest in their students’
appearance before they leave for school so that the student and those around the student can fully
concentrate on the work at hand.

● Students will be asked to fix the violation by changing or adjusting their clothing.
● Parents will be contacted to bring appropriate clothing to school.
● CGBHS administration will provide appropriate clothing for the student to wear.
● The student will be assigned to an in-school suspension room until the clothing violation is resolved.","appropriate/inappropriate, disruption/distraction, respect/disrespect, professional/business, neat, clean, good taste, common sense",,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,backpacks:NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,none,none,,,,,none,,"religious, medical",,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,"alcohol, tobacco, drugs, vulgarity/profanity, discriminatory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,none,,none,,,,,,,Any,,,Any,,Any,,,,,Any,,yes,"This is not an exhaustive list and CGBHS administration may amend this policy during the school year if

Bandanas, do-rags of any color, gloves, hairnets, hanging belts, buckles with any inappropriate or gang
related symbols, or attire that has been identified by law enforcement agencies, as being associated
with gang activity may not be worn. Properly fitting clothing is to be worn. Clothing with holes, ragged
hems or cut-off hemlines, or made of transparent or fishnet fabric, or clothing that exposes the chest,

buildings. Low-cut tops, spaghetti straps, halter tops, backless tops, tube tops, A-shirts (muscle shirts),
clothing that allows for bare midriffs, low necklines, and/or short shorts are not allowed.
Undergarments cannot be showing. A general rule is that shirts should not be low-cut and display
cleavage. Straps should be at least 1 inch wide.
Articles of clothing that advertise illegal activities or promote the use of alcohol, tobacco or drug
products, promote acts of violence and/or intimidation, or that display sexually suggestive words or

with the dress code, they should contact an Assistant Principal at their school site prior to wearing
such attire or accessories to ensure compliance.

Appropriate wearing of apparel and cleanliness of person is important as a matter of health and aesthetics, as
well as being conducive to learning. With the rapidly changing styles of clothing, it is impossible to specify
everything that is acceptable for student dress. A good rule to follow is that if there is doubt concerning the
appropriateness of your clothes for school, DO NOT wear them until you check.
Dress code violations will be handled through the school discipline policy. Students who come to school
dressed inappropriately must change clothes to meet the school dress code before returning to class. Repeated
violations of dress code will result in discipline action. In order to preserve discipline and order in the school
and create a proper and safe learning environment, the following dress code will be enforced:
Girls
For girls, dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, and slacks are appropriate for school wear. For attire regarding length:
Shorts, dresses, and skirts shall be no more than one business card (2”) above the knee. Sheer apparel,
bare midriffs and /or backs, very low necklines (no cleavage), extremely tight garments, strapless tops, tank
tops, and spaghetti straps are not permissible. Skin-tight pants, such as jeggings, leggings, yoga pants, etc.,
may only be worn when otherwise permissible clothing (no more than one business card above the knee) is
worn over them. Undergarments should not be visible at any time.
Boys
For boys, jeans, slacks, shorts, sport shirts, jerseys, and tee shirts are appropriate. Tank tops or sleeveless
shirts ARE NOT appropriate. Shorts shall be no more than one business card (2”) above the knee.
Button type shirts should be properly closed, and belts must be buckled around the natural waistline.
Undergarments should not be visible at any time.
Girls and Boys
No pants and/or jeans may be worn that are ripped, torn or frayed where skin and/or undergarments may be
exposed above the knee. No racerback tops of any type are permitted. No tinting, streaking, or dying of
hair to unnatural hair colors is permitted without administrative approval. Hair must be worn appropriately so
it does not interfere with students’ vision or the teachers’ and/or administrators’ ability to maintain eye
contact. Contact lenses that alter students’ eyes to unnatural colors/designs are prohibited.
No hoods, hats, caps, sunglasses, chokers or bracelets that could be harmful, or any head covering will be
worn on school campus unless for religious or medical purposes except when approved by the administration.
Other prohibited items include: (1) large, long, and /or heavy chains, (2) studded or chained accessories, and
(3) sleepwear, including bedroom slippers, blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, etc. Shoes must be worn at all
times.
No clothing or other displays of suggestive, sexual or profane wording or symbols or advertising of alcohol or
tobacco or illegal products will be permitted. Clothing that suggests gang affiliation, non-sanctioned clubs, or
racially offensive subject matter will not be tolerated. Caps/hats/hoods/bandanas may not be worn in the
school building.
No visible body piercing (other than ears) will be allowed. No tongue piercing is allowed. Gang related
markings or tattoos or any other distraction that is detrimental to the educational environment will not be
permitted. Visible drawings/markings are not permitted on student’s skin (markers, etc.).
Any other questionable attire will be handled on an individual basis at the discretion of the
administration.

So let’s be honest -- what are really the current issues at South Albany?
The biggest issues we have at South Albany in terms of dress code are
 Our gentlemen wearing pants/shorts that are sagging--sharing their underwear with everyone
 Our young ladies wearing tops that are strapless, plunge or are low cut and draw attention to their
chest
 Our young ladies wearing tops that expose their underwear or mid-drift (stomach)
 Very short shorts seem to come out in the nice weather (rule is mid-thigh length)
 Once in a while, we get bandanas or other gang associated clothing
 From there, we have a small number of other items on the “don’t list” below
The following pages are from a PRIDE Team presentation that describes the expectations and
encourages students to show their RedHawks Pride through their choice of apparel.
“The Do NOT List” -- Unacceptable Dress and Appearance: The following types of clothing and
accessories will not be permitted at school and/or school sponsored activities:
 Clothing or material which represent or advertise tobacco, alcohol or any controlled substances
 Clothing or items which contain inappropriate racial, sexual or gender messages
 Clothing or materials which contain inappropriate language

expected to maintain an appearance that is not distracting to teachers or other students, disrespectful to others, or
disruptive to the educational process. In addition, student attire must comply with standards of health and safety.
(Ex.: State law requires that shoes must be worn in public buildings.)
Symbols, emblems, badges, signs, words, objects or pictures on clothing, jewelry or personal items that
represent gangs, tobacco, drugs, alcohol, or discriminatory references to sex, race, or religion, or that are
lewd, vulgar, or obscene, are not permitted. (See District 112 policies on Sexual, Racial and Religious
Harassment and Violence.) It is not the intention of this Dress Code to interfere with a student’s right to express
38
political, religious, philosophical, or similar opinions by wearing apparel on which such messages are stated. Such
messages usually are acceptable as long as they are not lewd, vulgar, obscene, defamatory, or profane; do not
advocate violence or harassment of others, and do not promote products or activities that are illegal for use by
minors.
Examples of prohibited attire include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Clothing or hairstyles depicting gang symbols, look-alike gang symbols or gang hand gestures, including
do/doo rags or look-alike do/doo rags (i.e. large scarves tied about the head.);
• Tattoos depicting gang symbols or gang messages;
• Confederate flags, swastikas, Nazi symbols, or portions thereof;
• Clothing using language that is vulgar, sexually suggestive, or demeaning of others;
• Items referring to or suggestive of alcohol, drugs, gangs, tobacco, sex, and references to male/female body
parts;
• Roller blades, shoes with rollerblades or skateboards;
• Spikes or cleats;
When a student’s appearance violates the Dress Code, the student will be required to change his/her attire and
additional consequences may be imposed, at the discretion of school officials, including sending the student home to
change clothes. In exercising discretion to discipline and/or impose other consequences on students violating this
Dress Code, school officials shall take into account the age of the student, District 112’s student discipline policy,
and whether the violation occurred during the instructional day while school was in session or in connection with a
school related activity. Students sent home for inappropriate attire will be considered unexcused during their
absence from school.","health, safe/safety, disruption/distraction, respect/disrespect",,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,none,,,none,,,cleats:NA,,,,,none,,,,,,none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"gangs, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, vulgarity/profanity, discriminatory, obscene, illegal for minors, sexually suggestive, references to body parts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"gang related tattoos:NA, confederate flags, swastikas, Nazi symbols",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Any,,,,,,Any,,,Any,,,no,,
