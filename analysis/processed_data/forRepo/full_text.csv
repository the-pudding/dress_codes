"HICKSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL","NY","https://www.hicksvillepublicschools.org/parents/code_of_conduct","All students are expected to give proper attention to personal cleanliness and to dress appropriately for school and school functions. Students and their parents have the primary responsibility for acceptable student dress and appearance. Teachers and all other district personnel should exemplify and reinforce acceptable student dress and help students develop an understanding of appropriate appearance in the school setting.

 

A student's dress, grooming and appearance, including hairstyle/color, jewelry, make‑up and nails, shall:

 

1.                  Be safe, appropriate and not disrupt or interfere with the educational process.  The changing styles of day to day, the different values of parents and students, as well as individual interpretation, prevent a detailed description that encompasses every eventuality.  However, scant or skimpy clothing is not considered appropriate dress for school.

2.                  Ensure that underwear is completely covered with outer clothing.

3.                  Include footwear at all times. Footwear that is a safety hazard will not be allowed.

4.                  Not include the wearing of hats in the classroom except for a medical or religious purpose.

5.                  Not include items that are vulgar, obscene, libelous or denigrate others on account of race, color, religion, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability.

6.                  Not promote and/or endorse the use of alcohol, tobacco or illegal drugs and/or encourage other illegal or violent activities.

7.                  Be appropriate to a specific educational purpose and not inhibit their full and safe participation. (Ed.law 12:84)

 

Each building principal or his or her designee shall be responsible for informing all students and their parents of the student dress code at the beginning of the school year and any revisions to the dress code made during the school year.

 

Students who violate the student dress code shall be required to modify their appearance by covering or removing the offending item and, if necessary or practical, replacing it with an acceptable item. Any student who refuses to do so shall be subject to discipline, up to and including in-school suspension for the day. Any student who repeatedly fails to comply with the dress code shall be subject to further discipline, up to and including out-of-school suspension."

safety hazards. The student and parent may determine the student's personal dress and grooming
standards, provided that the student's dress and grooming meets the requirements of the student dress
code.
The principal/designee, in connection with the sponsor, coach, or other person in charge of an extracurricular
activity, may regulate the dress and grooming of students who participate in the activity if the
principal/designee reasonably believes that the student's dress or grooming:
1. Creates a hazard to the student's safety or to the safety of others.
2. Will prevent, interfere with, or adversely affect the purpose, direction, or effort required for the
activity to achieve its goal.
Dress Code Violations
1. If the student's dress or grooming is objectionable under these provisions, the
principal/designee shall request the student make appropriate corrections. In order that
students not miss valuable class time by going home to change clothing or waiting for a parent
to bring clothing, the student will be given alternate clothing to wear that is approved by school
administration.
2. If the student refuses to wear the alternative clothing or attempts to remove the clothing before
the end of the school day, the student may be subject to ISS (In-school suspension) or being sent
home. If a student chooses to go home because of a dress code issue, an unexcused absence will
be given for the classes missed.
3. Students who violate the dress code may be subject to immediate disciplinary action.
4. Students who violate provisions of the dress code relating to extra-curricular activities may be
removed or excluded from the extra-curricular activities for such period as the
principal/designee and activity sponsor may determine.
Attire
Student attire should be appropriate, decent, and non-disruptive. The school administration will
determine whether a student's attire is potentially disruptive.
Guidelines for students are as follows:
1. Wearing articles of clothing that promote gangs, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs is prohibited.
2. Clothing with language, pictures, or drawings, which may be interpreted as obscene, will not

inappropriate sleeveless shirts or mini-skirts, clothing which reveals a bare midriff or
undergarments. Shirts and blouses must cover the width of the shoulder. Judgment on the
modesty of a student’s dress lies with administration.
4. Headdress articles will not be permitted on campus. This includes but is not limited to caps,
hats, bandannas, toboggans, visors, and etc.
5. Sunglasses (except by written permission of physician) or improper eyewear will not be

Grooming
Cleanliness and proper grooming are necessary for students to project a positive image, and personal
appearance affects behavior. Because of the importance of appearance, RISD has established these
guidelines to be followed:
1. Unusual hairstyles considered to be inappropriate in a school setting will not be permitted. This
also includes inappropriate hair coloring, style, length, and/or fad haircuts (ex. mohawks). All
styles considered to be potentially disruptive cannot be listed; therefore the school
administration will determine whether a particular style is to be considered disruptive and
inappropriate.
2. Hair length is deemed to be excessive if it is below the collar in the back and sides of the head,
and below the eyebrows in the front.
3. Designs cut into a student’s hair will not be permitted.
4. Facial hair that is neatly trimmed close to the face will be permitted.
5. Unusual facial make-up or adornments that may be considered to be a possible disruption will
not be allowed.
It is the responsibility of teachers and administrators to judge the appropriateness of a student's
attire and personal grooming. Students are encouraged to ask the opinion of school
administrators before purchasing questionable clothing or changing personal appearance in a way
that according to these guidelines might be considered inappropriate."

"NORTH FORT MYERS HIGH SCHOOL","FL","https://nfm.leeschools.net/our_school/dress_code","The purpose of the Dress Code is to encourage students to focus on the learning process without the distractions of unsuitable dress and grooming. Students shall maintain a clean, orderly appearance at all times. The responsibility for the personal appearance of the student and the adherence to the dress code policy rests with the parent/guardian and the student.

student in seeking their educational goals. Just as a successful person in the community considers it important
to be appropriately dressed and groomed, so also should a student be concerned with these matters. Factors such

bizarre dress or grooming can be a disruptive influence in the classroom and detrimental to the development of
a positive climate for teaching and learning. Appropriate dress and grooming outside the school building or

2. Dress or grooming will meet the general decency standards of our community and of our students
in Tomahawk High School.
3. Student dress or grooming will not be disruptive to the education of other students in the
classrooms or study halls and in no way hinder the educational process.
4. Special classes (shops, labs, etc.) may establish additional rules governing dress and hair. Safety of
students requires guidelines for shop classes, labs, etc.
5. All students will dress appropriately for physical education classes.
6. Footwear must be worn at all times.

The following things will not be allowed in our school:
1. Wearing of hats, bandannas, hoods or similar headwear between the hours of 8:05 A.M. and 3:30

The District has the responsibility to ensure proper and appropriate conditions for learning, along with protecting the health and safety of its student body.  Even though the schools will allow a wide variety of clothing styles, dress and grooming must not materially or substantially disrupt the educational process of the school or create a health or safety hazard for students, staff, or others. The Superintendent shall establish procedures for the monitoring of student dress and grooming in school or while engaging in extracurricular activities. 
Administrative Guidelines for Student Dress
The school's job is to help students become productive and successful adults. Not all rules are written. This is the students’ workplace. Part of being in a workplace is knowing what is appropriate and what is not. The teachers and the staff have a responsibility to help students learn the unwritten rules of what is right and appropriate for the workplace.
As there is a wide interpretation of tank top shirts and dresses, judgment of appropriateness will be based on the modesty of the necklines, the width of the shoulder strap, and the length of the hem.  Skirt and short(s) length must not be excessively short, as to disrupt or exceed generally held notions of modesty.  Most of the shoulder, neck, and legs need to be covered.  The following is not acceptable for student dress:
See through clothing 
Clothing that allows a bare midriff 
Clothing that is revealing of undergarments, including spandex and boxer shorts
Clothing that has cut-outs or holes which expose any portion of the midriff or private parts of the body and/or underwear
Heavy chains, spiked collars, spiked wristbands, and items that are dangerous to others
Clothing that promotes or alludes to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gangs or other subject matter that is inappropriate for school     
Any form of dress or hairstyle which is considered contrary to good hygiene, or which is distracting or disruptive, or potentially hazardous in laboratory situations (VoAg, Industrial Arts, and Science) will not be permitted.
Hats or caps may not be worn in the school or in a classroom at any time, except during special events (such as Spirit Days).  Those special events must be approved by the District Superintendent.

dress must not disrupt the educational process, interfere with positive teaching/learning climate, or compromise
reasonable standards of safety and decency within the school setting. All dress code conflicts should be handled with
discretion.
The purpose of the dress code is to permit students to wear comfortable clothing and allow students to express identity
through clothing of their choosing without the fear of judgement or punishment. Our goal is to be fair and equitable
regardless of student body type or size, income, religion, ethnicity, race, sex, gender identification, gender expression,
sexual orientation, culture, and self identification. Clothing that disrupts learning environment and educational processes
will be restricted. Examples of these restrictions include clothing or accessories that include derogatory/disrespectful
language and images, relating to profanity, hate speech, racial insensitivity, fighting words, vulgar/obscene speech,
threatening language, and pornography.

day.
● Put on alternative clothing temporarily provided by school to wear for the remainder of the school day.
● Call parent to bring alternative clothing to wear for the remainder of the school day.
Dress code enforcement should not target students based on body type or size, income, religion, ethnicity, race, sex,
gender identification, gender expression, sexual orientation, culture, and self identification. Dress code enforcement
should not hold stricter to gender nonconforming and transgender students. Dress code acts of “shaming” are strictly
prohibited. Such forbidden acts considered, but not limited to are:

any special circumstance relating to dress. Please understand that a dress code violation is a
discipline matter and will be dealt with as such. Also, please know the dress code policy

the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day, until the
problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of clothing to the
school. Repeated offenses may result in more serious disciplinary action in accordance with the

ethnic, religious, or political point of view. Students also have a
responsibility to dress and act in a manner which is appropriate for
school.
Student’s school attire should adhere to accepted standards of
decency, should not pose a threat to public or personal health and
safety, or be disruptive or distracting to classroom activity or pupil
behavior. Apparel with prohibited slogans or designs printed on
them will not be allowed. Whenever there is a disagreement
between the school and the student about appearance, admission
to class will not be permitted until the problem has been resolved
with the student’s parent or guardian.
Life is full of choices. Students have the right to choose both their
actions and their own style of dress every day. They also have a
responsibility to make good choices. The school staff has the
responsibility to make professional judgments regarding the
appropriateness of those actions and dress based upon standards
stated above. A student’s manner of dress would be considered
inappropriate if it were “unusual” enough to distract either other
students or the teacher from educational activities in the classroom
or to disrupt the positive, safe climate on campus.
The following may not be worn at school:
• head gear of any type. No head gear may be worn from the
time a student enters school until the time a student leaves
school. This applies to headgear of any kind, including but
not limited to: hats, bandanas, scarves, sweatbands, dorags,
etc. Outside hats may be put on in the school lobby
as the student leaves the building. Elementary hat policy
during cold weather may differ to ensure student safety.
• Articles of clothing, accessories, or footwear that
advertise, depict, or condone the use of alcohol, drugs,
tobacco, violence, inappropriate language, or sexual
behavior/innuendo, purposeful harm to oneself, suicide,
gang membership, or gang behavior.
• Articles of clothing, accessories, or footwear that signify
gang affiliation. Known styles of gang-related dress, as
verified by local authorities, shall not be worn, possessed,
or displayed at school, or at any school sponsored events.
This may include pants that sag (pants must be worn at
the waist even if a shirt covers the waistline), a single
raised pant leg, bandanas, or similar looking items worn as
an accessory; colors, symbols or numbers representing or
having special significance within gang culture; sports
clothing of specific teams; beads and necklaces; belt
buckles with gang initials; gang themed t-shirts with gang
photos, prison scenes, graffiti, or slogans. Display of body
tattoos which are gang-related are also prohibited and
must be covered during school hours and at school
events. Should other possible displays or styles of gangrelated
dress come to the attention of school officials, local
authorities will verify it, unless it becomes a disruption
beforehand.
• Articles of clothing that are provocative or revealing in
nature, including those constructed from spandex or
similar form-clinging fabric; leggings or tights without a
shirt, tunic, skirt, or shorts of suitable length over them;
spaghetti straps; low necklines; clothing that reveals
underwear; bare midriffs; bare shoulders, including racer
backs; bare backs; low-cut tops or dresses; halter tops,
etc. All cleavage must be completely covered.
Undergarments of males and females may not be
exposed, even when a student leans over or sits down. All
tops must overlap or be completely tucked into pants,
shorts or skirts to avoid any bare midriff or lower back.
• Skirts or dresses that are shorter than 6 inches above the
knee, and shorts that are shorter than mid-thigh, whether
sitting, standing, or bending over. Private body parts shall
be covered at all times. No undergarments or parts thereof
may be exposed at any time.
• Articles of clothing that are considered lounge-wear,
pajamas, etc.
• Articles of clothing or accessories that disparage or
humiliate any group, or individual for any reason, including
but not limited to national origin, gender, race, religion,
sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
• Items of jewelry or accessories which pose a hazard, wallet
chains, spike collars or necklaces, spiked bracelets, safety
pin jewelry, choke chains, bicycle chains, earrings
connected to a nose ring via a chain, etc.
• Sunglasses
• Tattoos of a design or in a location disruptive to school order
Consequences for initial violation of the dress code will be

footwear, or accessories, and 2) parental contact.

responsibly to uphold the standards of the school environment. Appropriate dress has a positive impact on
student learning, concentration, behavior, and the overall educational environment. We believe that NHS
students should take pride in their personal appearance. With this in mind, in an effort to create a safe
environment, appropriate dress should be worn for both the school day and all events that are sponsored by the
school:
Students are expected to exercise good judgment in their style of dress as well as demonstrate respect for those
around them.
Dress that distracts or disrupts the educational process and mission of the school is prohibited.
The basic guidelines of decency, modesty, good taste, cleanliness and practicality should prevail. At all times,
students should treat school as if it were a place of business and dress accordingly. Research has proven that
when students dress this way it promotes a more serious atmosphere and students take school more seriously.
Inappropriate dress includes, but is not limited to:
1. Designs on clothing which display poor taste, advocate for drugs, alcohol, sex or tobacco, or that is
uncomfortably revealing and causes embarrassment to others.

No undergarments should show at any time including boxer shorts or bras.

2. Designs on clothing, which displays inappropriate symbols, language, ethnic slurs, or any attire which could
be construed as offensive to anyone in the building.
3. Dress intended for outside wear or other material that covers the face and/or interferes with the identification
of a student such as HATS, visors, hoods, bandanas, sunglasses, etc. are prohibited. Wearing hats in a public
building is generally considered inappropriate except when wearing for religious reasons or relating to a
disability.
Such items should be removed upon entering the building and MUST be stored in the student‟s locker for the
day.
Any teacher may confiscate hats, sunglasses, or headphones that are not stored in the student‟s locker during
school hours. Student‟s refusing to turn over the items will be cited for insubordination and face disciplinary consequences.Chains, wallet chains and/or spiked collars/bracelets or any non-school related item that could be used as a
weapon are prohibited.
5. Jackets, coats, or other outerwear may not be worn during the school day and should be stored in lockers.
6. Backpacks, or shoulder packs, of any type must be stored in lockers during the school day.
7. Appropriate footwear must be worn at all times.
8. No bare midriffs or shoulders, visible under garments, or equivalent types.(e.g. spaghetti straps, halter
tops, tube tops, muscle shirts ) Tank tops must have straps that are a minimum of 3 fingers wide with no visible
undergarments)
9. Length of shorts, and „skorts‟ must be no more than 4-5” above the knee or at least mid-thigh (whichever is
LONGER) Skirts and dresses that are less than knee length must have some type of undergarment (e.g. tights,
spandex, other shorts) worn that meets the same criteria as the length of shorts. Note: Rips or holes in garments
must be below the minimum length requirement as stated and may not be worn if they are inappropriately
revealing.
If a violation occurs, students will be required to correct the situation. Corrective action may include a change of

"COE-BROWN NORTHWOOD ACADEMY","NH","http://coebrown.org/handbook/#toggle-id-15","The Academy provides the following Dress Code as our efforts to assist students in maintaining an academic appearance that promotes a focus on learning.

The following guidelines apply except for school-wide events where special dress is permitted.

Overall expectations for all students:

All students are expected to be neat and clean.
All should be modestly dressed in attire appropriate to the classroom. Modesty means that no bellies, breasts, buttocks, or underwear should be showing. This should be true when climbing stairs, sitting at a desk as well as standing. Garments should not be transparent or sheer, without a dress code appropriate garment underneath.
Dress or appearance disruptive to the learning process will not be tolerated.
All clothing must be neat and clean and free of rips and tears. No raw fabric edges should be exposed.
Specifics:

Head coverings (such as hats, hoods, or bandanas) will not be worn in school, except for medical or religious exemption as approved by Headmaster.
Appropriate footwear is required at all times; slippers are not permitted.
Shirt requirements:
Material of the shirt must have at least a “three finger’s” width strap.
The sleeve must be hemmed and sewn with no raw edges.
Shirts must cover the entire midriff.
Inappropriate pictures or lettering are not allowed on shirts or other clothing.  This includes advertising for alcoholic beverages or alcohol/drug/tobacco related messages, weapons, violent acts, sexual innuendo, or derogatory or threatening statements.  Clothing that contains images or messages that prompt social injustice is also deemed inappropriate.
Shorts will be allowed throughout the year. Short restrictions:
Athletic shorts (with or without pockets), cutoff shorts, and shorts with holes or rips are not permitted.
Students in classes conducting outdoor activities during wet or cool weather cannot use the wearing of shorts as a valid excuse for non-participation.  Students should dress appropriately for the planned activities.
Length of shorts must be modest in nature (see Overall Expectations #2.)
Shorts are not appropriate for field trips.
All students will have extra clothing for physical education class and will change for class when required.
Students will wear protective clothing when required for class – such items as laboratory aprons, coveralls, safety glasses, etc.
Skirts and dresses must be modest in nature (see Overall Expectations # 2.)
Dress straps must be at least “three finger’s width at the shoulder. No halter top dresses will be permitted.
Pajamas, long athletic pants or sweatpants with or without pockets are not appropriate for school wear.

No chains of any kind may be worn.
ENFORCEMENT
Students who do not adhere to these requirements will not be permitted to attend class or the activity involved until the dress code violation has been remedied.

A student whose manner of dress appears to be in violation will be immediately sent to their guidance counselor.  (If their regular counselor is unavailable, another counselor will address the situation).  If their style of dress is indeed in violation of the dress code an administrative referral will be filed, and:

First Dress Code Violation
The student will be required to change to appropriate clothing before being allowed to return to class.  If they do not have appropriate clothing with them, they will either have to borrow such clothing from another student (no interruptions of another student’s class will be allowed) or they will have to contact a parent to bring them school appropriate attire.

Students will remain in the guidance waiting area until such time as they have appropriate dress.  They will not return to class until the situation is resolved.  If lunch period comes during the time the student is waiting for clothes to change, the student may go to the dining hall to get lunch but will return immediately to the guidance area to eat.

Second Dress Code Violation
Same as above plus an administrative detention will be assigned.

Third Dress Code Violation (and any subsequent violations)
Student may be assigned a Saturday School and a parent conference may and/or a hearing with the Education Committee of the Board of Trustees may be scheduled.

Students will be allowed to go home to change only with specific parent permission at that time, regardless of senior release status.  Time out of class for referral, in-house correction of dress situation, waiting for parents to bring appropriate clothing or during the time the student may be dismissed to go home to change will count as class absences."

Caps and hats should not be worn inside the building. Clothing identified as gang symbols or style of dress will
not be allowed. No face paint may be worn. Dress that may disrupt classroom work or school functions may

Therefore, certain standards of dress are expected to be upheld by students. Each student shall
be responsible for maintaining appropriate school dress and personal grooming standards which
result in a neat, clean personal appearance. Extreme or sloppy styles that are distracting and
disruptive to the learning environment will not be allowed. Cooperation by parents/ guardians in
keeping with the standards of dress is necessary. Administration, faculty and staff will work
together to ensure that appropriate dress is maintained. If it does not appear that students have
given their dress and appearance the attention warranted, students must be asked to improve
upon it. Students may also be removed from the classroom until they can improve their dress
and appearance. Students will be asked to change and parents will be required to bring
appropriate clothing to the school for the student to wear. If they do not have anything to change
into they will be sent home to change. Repeated failure to follow appropriate standards of dress
will result in progressive discipline. Parental support is expected. Students who participate in

morals, conduct, dress, attitude, courtesy, and friendliness on the part of each student which will be
above reproach or criticism. In keeping with the above aim, a student's appearance, mode of dress,
and/or cleanliness shall not disrupt the educational process, or constitute a threat to safety.
When in the judgment of the principal, the student's appearance, mode of dress, and/or cleanliness is
distracting and disruptive to the educational process, or constitutes a threat to safety of acceptable
standards of sanitation, or does not meet the following regulations, the student will be required to
make requested modifications. If the student must go home to meet the requirements, the absence
will be counted as one of their absences for the semester and a parent/administrator conference will
be required.
To implement the above policy, the following regulations have been adopted:
1. Shorts, skorts, skirts, and dresses will not be acceptable when it is determined that they are
inappropriate due to fit and/or length. Shorts, skirts, skorts, and dresses will be no more than
two inches above the top of the kneecap. No nylon or spandex shorts or leotards shall be
worn without a garment over them, determined to be acceptable.

 garments will be permitted. (Example: No strapless, see-through, or low-cut garments, or
 spaghetti straps.)
 7. Garments will not be worn that are determined to be unacceptable because of slogans or art

 of an obscene nature (example, playboy bunny logo).
 8. NO student shall wear nose rings or nose studs or any type of body piercing instruments with
 the exception of ear rings in the ears.

Appearance or dress may be a controversial matter as fashion changes in society. It is
the district’s position that since a student is spending a limited amount of time on campus they
should abide by the dress code restrictions they are asked to follow. The district acknowledges
that the dress requirements may be somewhat subjective; however, it is felt they are
reasonable requests. Students are encouraged to talk with school officials if they aren’t sure
whether a certain clothing item is appropriate so school administration may make the
necessary decision regarding questionable apparel.
It is the intent of the K-12 Dress Code to make all students and their parents/guardians
aware of what is considered suitable for an appropriate learning environment. We are aware
that some items listed are associated with teenage fads that do not necessarily affect younger
students. Discretion will be used in determining appropriate dress for different age groups.
REPEATED VIOLATIONS OF THE DRESS CODE SHALL RESULT IN APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY
ACTION BEING TAKEN.
A. Principal Conference and change
B. 3 days ISS or corporal punishment
C. 5 days ISS

are vital to each member of the school community. Developing good tastes in attire, good
grooming habits, and good behavior are a part of the educational program. Students of the
Laurens County School System are expected to dress in a manner that is supportive of a
positive learning environment that is free of distractions and disruptions. There is a direct 
34
correlation between student dress and student behavior. Students will be expected to observe
modes of dress, styles of hair, and personal grooming which support the learning
environment. The purpose of this dress code is to assure that consistency and interpretation is
implemented county-wide, thus providing equitable treatment for all students. In making a
judgment concerning the appropriateness of a student’s dress or grooming, the principal
should adhere to the guidelines set forth in the procedures that accompany this policy. The
principal of the school is charged with the enforcement of the student dress code. The
principal is given wide latitude of discretion in the determination of proper or improper dress
and behavior of students. Students who are found to be in violation of the dress code are
subject to disciplinary action.

remainder of the school day. If required, the administration may ask a student to turn
a shirt/blouse inside-out if the garment contains writing or an image that is
inappropriate for school.
**NOTE: Certain school environments or classes may require more restrictive dress
due to safety issues. (Ex.: CTAE/Connection classes, science labs, physical education)

following policy statement on student dress and appearance:
A student's appearance is primarily the responsibility of the student and his/her parents. The
student dress policy is intended to be non-discriminatory and non-punitive. However, a student's
attire and grooming must be of such nature so as not to endanger his/her education, health or
safety or that of others. The school cannot permit clothing to be worn that is damaging to school
property or disruptive to the educational process. Students are expected to be neat, clean, and
orderly in appearance. When a particular form of dress is deemed offensive or contributes in
any way to the disruption of the school, the student will be asked to change (with no further
consequences unless a situation is escalated by the student’s refusal to change). The dress
code is to be followed at all times including extra-curricular activities (dances, field trips, etc.).
The following guidelines will help parents/guardians and students interpret the dress policy.
A. Health and safety:
 Hats, hoods, visors, headbands, or hair should not obstruct vision or in any
way hinder or endanger students in school activities or classes.
 A student's person and clothing should be clean.
 Clothing should be appropriate to the weather and temperature of the
building. 
 Footwear adequate to protect the feet from injury should be worn at all times
(bare and stocking feet are prohibited).
 Sunglasses should not be worn.
B. Attire/grooming potentially disruptive to the educational process:
 Extremely short, loose, or tight clothing such that the undergarments or body
may be exposed; see-through or transparent clothing.
 Sexually explicit pictures, offensive language or images, or messages
promoting violence, drugs, tobacco, vaping, or alcohol.
 Wallet chains or studded accessories; noisy jewelry.
 Hats, hoods, visors, headbands, or other head coverings may be worn in the
school building, but must be removed without question at the request of a
member of staff if they pose a hindrance or danger in school activities.
Because of the nature of certain school activities, the school reserves the right to specify the
proper attire. These activities include dances, trips by school groups, and activities outside the
regular curriculum, including athletic trips. The principal or his/her designee has the authority to
interpret and enforce the policy statement on school dress."

that organization’s dress and grooming standards in order to remain in compliance with that 
organization’s rules. These extra‐curricular or organization‐level rules may be stricter than 
those applying to the general high school student body. 
If the principal determines that a student’s grooming or clothing violates the school’s dress 
code, the student will be given an opportunity to correct the problem at school. If not 
corrected, the student may be assigned to in‐school suspension for the remainder of the day, 
until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of

Students are expected to adhere to reasonable levels of cleanliness and modesty. Students are expected to wear clothing that is appropriate to their age level and that does not disrupt the school or educational environment.  At school or at school-sponsored activities, hats and any other clothing displaying/advertising items that; promote or condone illegal activities and/or substances promote the use and/or legalization of alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substances; displays obscene material, profanity, vulgar statements, satanic symbols, gang symbols, hate messages, sexual innuendos, suicide, intolerance, violent messages, reference to subversion, or other messages which are interpreted as being inappropriate or offensive, are considered a violation of this policy.

If the student’s dress or hygiene interferes with the normal classroom procedure, health of the person involved, and/or health or welfare of other students, it shall be the duty of any staff member to address the issue in an appropriate manner.  Students will be asked to find alternative clothing and/or change their attire.  If the situation cannot be handled by staff, the counselor(s) or building administrator will handle it.  If students refuse or disagree with the alleged violation, the building administrator will handle it by having the student correct the condition in question.  Additional disciplinary action may be taken if the situation is not corrected and/or the student has multiple offenses violating the student dress code.

drawing attention to yourself. Clothing items that are vulgar, have obscene slogans on them, or are likely to cause a disruption to the efficient and orderly operation
of the school will not be tolerated.
Any student wearing inappropriate clothing may be asked to change, turn the clothing inside out, or entirely remove the clothing, if possible. If this is not possible
or if a student refuses to change or reverse the article of clothing, the student's parent may be contacted and asked to come pick up the child from school for the
remainder of the day. The principal or counselor may also take a student home to change clothes. Our intent for these limits is for students to understand that
school is a workplace, and what may be appropriate outside the workplace may not be appropriate at work.
Examples which will result in the student being asked to change include but are not limited to:
● Extremes in attire and/or appearance will not be tolerated such as halter tops, low cut tops, excessively tight shirts, midriff shirts, short shorts, face
paint, or non-permanent hair color.

within the constraints of reasonable rules and appropriate standards that are consistent with the maintenance of an effective learning
atmosphere and good personal hygiene. The Board expects each student's attire and grooming to promote a positive, safe and healthy
environment within the school. The Board has determined that reasonable regulation of school attire and personal adornment is within
its authority and consistent with its responsibility to provide an appropriate environment for learning. Although the Board recognizes
that individual students have a right to free expression, that right must be balanced with the Board's responsibility to provide a safe,
secure and orderly educational environment for all students. Although the Board wishes for each student to accept responsibility for
following the rules it understands and appreciates both the authority and responsibility of the parent/guardian relative to student dress.
The Board solicits the support of parents/guardians in the enforcement of its dress code.
General Rules: The following decorations and/or designs are not permitted:
● Symbols, mottoes, words or acronyms that convey crude, vulgar, profane, violent, death-oriented, gang-related, sexually
explicit, or sexually suggestive messages.
● Symbols, mottoes, words or acronyms advertising tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia.
● Clothing that conveys double meaning messages.
Permitted garments shall be clean and in good repair.
Permitted clothing shall be worn as designed/manufactured to include the following:
● Shirts/blouses must be appropriately buttoned
● Zippers on pants and shirts must be zipped
● Pants and shorts will be worn at the waist
● Belts must be fastened
All students participating in approved school activities are expected to comply with required dress and personal appearance
regulations of the activity in which they are participating. Students who refuse to dress as required by the school or sponsor will not be
permitted to participate in the activity or to represent the school in any way.
Outerwear: Students must store outerwear (coats, hats, gloves, scarves, etc.) in their lockers upon arrival at school.
Head Coverings: Caps, hats or other similar head coverings shall not be worn to class or within school buildings unless prescribed by a
physician, previously approved by the school's administration for religious reasons, or approved by the school's administration for a
special school activity.
Sunglasses: (unless prescribed by a physician) shall not be worn to class or within school buildings.
Upper Garments: The cut of sleeveless garments must not expose undergarments or be otherwise immodest. Strapless garments are
prohibited. Shoulder straps of permitted garments must be a minimum of the width of two fingers of the person wearing the garment.
Bare midriffs, immodestly low cut necklines, off the shoulder, or bare backs are prohibited. Garments must be of appropriate length,
cut and/or fit to meet these requirements while sitting and/or bending.Lower Garments: Undergarments shall not be visible. Pants and
shorts shall be worn at the waist. Tights or leggings worn as outerwear, will be permitted to be worn. This includes Yoga pants and
Jeggings.
Bathing/swimming wear, sleep wear (including pajamas), etc., are not permitted. If the garments are immodest, even if they do not
meet one of the “names” above, the student will be asked to change.
Shorts and skirts must be of modest length defined as a maximum of 6"" above the knee of the wearer or not above the fingertip of the
wearer with the arm fully extended, whichever is longer.
Footwear: Students shall wear appropriate footwear for protection and hygienic reasons while on school grounds, participating in
school activities, or on school transportation. House slippers, and shower shoes are examples of unacceptable footwear.
Accessories: Dog collars, chains of any manner, or other jewelry/accessories that pose a safety concern for the student or others are
prohibited.
Religious and Health Accommodation: Where a bona fide religious belief or health need of a student conflicts with the school dress
code, reasonable accommodation shall be provided. Any student desiring accommodation shall notify the school principal in writing
of the requested accommodation and the factual basis for the request. Approved coverings worn as part of a student's bona fide
religious practices or beliefs shall not be prohibited under this policy.
Clothing Assistance: It is the policy of the Board that no student will be denied an education due to a bona fide financial inability to
obtain clothing that complies with the school dress code. Any student for whom compliance with the school dress code poses a bona
fide financial burden may submit a written request for clothing needed, together with a statement of financial need. School principals,
or their designees, shall assist families in financial need to obtain clothing that complies with the school dress code. In meeting
requests for assistance, principals, or their designees, shall consider community resources such as clothing donations from school
personnel, merchants, parent organizations, and charitable organizations, financial assistance, and providing additional time for a
student to obtain clothing that complies with the school dress code.
Penalties/Sanctions: Students who elect not to conform to the dress and grooming rules will be given the opportunity to conform to
the dress code. Those students who do not have appropriate clothing at school will be sent home; an unexcused absence will be
assigned for the time it takes the student to return. Students must serve detention time in compliance with the unexcused absence
rule, which is double the time a student misses due to the unexcused absence.
Unusual Circumstances: If any unusual situation relative to dress or grooming arises which is not specifically covered in this policy,
the building administrator shall have the authority to decide if it fits within school appropriateness.
The dress code is in effect throughout the entire school year, INCLUDING semester test days. Students not meeting the dress
code on semester test days may be sent home, impacting the students ability to take a semester test, and resulting in a lower
grade for the course."

✓ to ensure the health and safety of all students,
✓ to prevent disruptions to the learning environment, and
✓ to encourage students in appropriate dress habits so they are prepared for the
professional world beyond high school and college.
To some extent, any dress code involves a degree of subjectivity concerning what is and
is not acceptable, and what may or may not be disruptive. Again, the primary reason for
the School District of Wausaukee’s dress code is to foster an atmosphere conducive to
learning for all our students. Students are encouraged to ask themselves the following
questions when choosing what to wear to school:
● Does my outfit promote modesty and respectability?
● Does my choice of clothing make those around me uncomfortable?
● Does my clothing expose too much?
● Does my clothing advertise something that is prohibited to minors?
● Are there obscene, profane, drug-related, gang-related, or inflammatory
messages on my clothing?
● Am I dressed appropriately for the weather?
With the mixed messages in the media today, it is sometimes difficult for students to
objectively judge the appropriateness of clothing items. Therefore, it is up to
parents/guardians and school staff to be an advocate for every student in this regard.
If a student has selected a manner of appearance that is beyond mere freedom of
expression, disrupts the educational process, presents a risk to themselves or others,
and/or causes disruption among students and/or staff, he/she will need to find something
more appropriate to wear.
General Guidelines
● Shoes must be worn at all times
● Clothing should be clean and unsoiled
● Clothing with improper slogans, writing or pictures is not allowed
● Hats and hoods are not to be worn in the building
Students who are representing the School District of Wausaukee at an official function or
public event may be required to follow specific dress requirements. Usually, this applies
to athletic teams, cheerleaders, bands, and other such groups.
Please see Appendix E for a visual aide intended to help students make appropriate
clothing choices. It is occasionally updated when a new fashion trend needs to be
addressed or when a particular dress code violation is more prevalent."

ethnic backgrounds. They attend public schools to learn – not only academic and
technical subjects, but tolerance and respect, as well. Respectful dress standards
are based upon both the school’s desire to enhance the learning process and the
student’s need to develop respect for others.
The Board recognizes that student individual dress is primarily a parental
responsibility that should reflect concern for health and safety of students, staff and
others. When the dress of an individual student constitutes a health problem, is
unsuitable for school wear, is a danger to any person, or causes a substantial and
material disruption or substantial disturbance, the principal shall take appropriate
action to correct the situation.
Teachers, administrators, and other school personnel – both in their classes and on
campus – will share the responsibility of enforcing the student dress code policy.
Teachers shall follow building procedure for disciplinary referrals regarding dress
code violations.
Students shall dress in a respectful manner, in order to: Promote the health, safety
and dignity of all students; Help preserve school property (beyond normal wear and
tear); Strike a balance between absolute freedom of expression and the community’s
sense of morality (common courtesy, tolerance, respect, and understanding among
all people, without exception); Discourage disruptions to the teaching and learning
process.
Students who violate this policy will be given an opportunity to correct the situation by

either changing the clothing, removing the clothing (if appropriate), wearing it inside-
out, or other means as determined by the principal so the student is in compliance

with this policy. Students who repeatedly violate this policy may face more severe
punishment, including detention, in-school suspension, or out-of-school suspension.

corrected, the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day,
until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of
clothing to the school. Repeated offenses may result in more serious disciplinary action in
accordance with the Student Code of Conduct."

intimidation, and safety, as well as school position and philosophy promoting an atmosphere
of tolerance. The School District reserves the right to determine what appropriate dress is.
Students are reminded that their appearance significantly affects the learning environment
and may even be a safety concern in some safety sensitive instructional areas of the school.
Students are not to wear clothing that may create material or substantial disruption of the
educational process; be destructive to persons or property; represent or encourage gang
activity; advertise alcoholic beverages or tobacco products; contain sexual connotations;
contain spikes or chains; exhibit offensive or suggestive language or graphics; or be
considered offensively revealing or distasteful.
• Headgear in the school building is prohibited. i.e.: (caps, head covers, bandanas,
sunglasses, etc.). Hair bands that are an inch or under will be acceptable.
• Undergarments and shoes are required. However, undergarments should be fully
covered including bra straps and waistbands and tops of ""boxers."" At no time should
undergarments be showing through holes or tears in jeans/shirts or below the length
of a skirt / shorts, etc. Slippers and Pajama pants are not allowed.
• Bare midriff, see-through and backless garments are not appropriate nor are tops
tied together by strings across the back or around the neck such as the ""bandana"" or
""halter"" tied tops. ""Muscle Shirts' (for either boys or girls), tube tops, tops with straps
that do not cover the bra strap are not appropriate, as in ""spaghetti straps."" Tank
tops are acceptable if the depth of the armhole does not reveal undergarments or
allow the chest and back to be visible through the armhole. Shorts/skirts should not
be shorter than the longest finger tip of the student's hand when the arms are
hanging at the student's side.
A good guideline is to dress in a manner that would be acceptable in the 'professional' and
'craft' job settings. Any other type of dress may be questioned and consequences assigned
as listed in the ""Discipline"" section of this handbook.
A teacher may require additional standards of student dress as deemed appropriate in order
to insure a proper safety standard for the coursework/activities required in the class (i.e.
science, vocational classes, P.E. and any special project, etc.). This may extend to footwear,
fabric content requirements, head coverings, safety protection, etc. Failure to comply with
these requirements may result in disciplinary action under the ""Dress Code"" policy as well as
possible loss of points or credit for any work that a student may be unable to complete as a
result of non-compliance with the regulation.
Regarding graduation ceremonies, graduates are expected to abide by the grooming and
dress recommendations in order to participate in the ceremony. The pride the community
takes in its graduates should appropriately be reflected in the dress of those wishing to
participate. Specifics will be forwarded during the spring of the year. Questions in advance
may be directed to the principal.

student dress or grooming practices which:
A. present a hazard to the health or safety of the student himself/herself or to others in the school;

health or safety, or the health and/or safety of others, or interferes in any way with anyone's right to an
education.
3. The final decision on any case will rest with the building principal.
B. The following is a list of unacceptable attire for school:

• All students must wear clothing that extends from the neck area to the shoulders. Any clothing that is not in
good taste and exposes undergarments or excessive amounts of flesh is not acceptable. Determination of
inappropriate clothing will be at the discretion of an administrator or his/her designee.

including gang symbols.
• Hats, coats, bandanas, sweat bands, the hood for a hooded sweatshirt, and sun glasses may not be worn in the
building during the school day.
• Hair styles, dress, and accessories that pose a safety hazard are not permitted in the laboratories, or during
physical education. (Hats may be worn on designated hat days).
• Clothing with holes, rips or tears above mid-thigh, and clothing that is otherwise poorly fitting, showing skin
and/or undergarments may not be worn at school.

hems.

Athletic shorts must cover mid-thigh to knee. (Spandex or frayed hem shorts will not be allowed).

• Running tights, yoga pants, leggings, may be worn if they are under clothing that is, itself, proper to wear. This
would include that proper clothing would cover from shoulders to mid-thigh. Pajama pants are not appropriate
dress for school, but may be worn on designated pajama days.

rules and laws outside the school setting. By recognizing that
appropriate dress is an issue which is addressed in the “real world”
by workplace requirements or professional standards and
expectations, students have an opportunity to learn that what is
acceptable and appropriate in one situation is not acceptable in
other situations. Clothing that may be fun or appropriate on the
weekend may not be appropriate for school.
Standards of dress are provided so clothing does not distract from
the educational process.
It is hoped that a minimum amount of time and effort is spent on
enforcement; however, it is the responsibility of the student and
parent to adhere to these guidelines.

"SHERIDAN HIGH SCHOOL","WY","https://scsd2.com/download/sheridan-high-school-student-handbook/","Student dress needs to convey respect for self and others. Appropriate dress is required at school and at school
activities/events so that our students are accustomed to dressing according to the expectations of future
employers and the general public. Styles that are immodest, extreme, or too revealing will not be tolerated
because they detract from the educational process. Students may not wear the following items: halter tops, tube
tops, spaghetti straps, enlarged armholes, or see-through material, nor may they expose bare midriffs, or show
cleavage. Shorts and skirts must be no shorter than mid-thigh in length. Underwear may not be shown. Clothing,
decorations, or jewelry, which promotes or depicts any controlled substance, alcoholic beverage, tobacco
products, or their use, is not appropriate. Attire that displays offensive words, phrases, sexual innuendo, or is
gang-related is inappropriate. Hats, head coverings, bandanas, and hoods are not to be worn in the building during
school hours. Sunglasses shall not be worn in the building, unless accompanied by a medical prescription. Shoes
with cleats need to be removed before entering the building. Students with inappropriate school attire will be sent
home or must change into school appropriate attire as determined by school officials."
"NELSON COUNTY HIGH","VA","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LR7h2kuC9a49H4EBGPCkUYZc13il4nUH/view","The administration of Nelson County High School understands that styles of dress are important forms
of expression for students. All students are expected to dress appropriately and safely for the 9th
-12th
grade learning environment. Nelson County High School is preparing students to enter the adult setting
upon completion of high school. With that adult setting comes expectations for appropriate dress.
Clothing should conform to expectations and standards of safety as well as follow the Code of Virginia.
1. Clothing, jewelry, and accessories should not:
 Have language or images that are vulgar, discriminatory, or obscene
 Advocate or promote illegal or violent conduct, including but not limited to the
unlawful use of weapons, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or drug paraphernalia
 Represent gang affiliation, membership, or activity
 Reflect adversely on any person due to race, gender, sexuality, creed, national origin, or
physical, emotional, or intellectual abilities
 Have the potential to be used as a weapon
2. Clothing must cover private parts, midriff, breasts and the back below the top of shoulder blades
to base of the buttocks. Clothing must cover private parts from the base of the midriff and lower

back to the middle of the thigh as measured from the groin to the middle of the knee. Any ex-
posed area referred to in the aforementioned sentences is considered private for all genders.

3. Compression shorts, tights, and leggings of any type should be covered following guideline #2.

4. Clothing must cover all undergarments. This includes sagging or low-cut pants or low-cut neck-
lines.

5. See-through material does not constitute covering the skin, material must be opaque.
6. Tops should be secured in place over the shoulders in such a way as to prevent any private parts
from potentially being exposed by the top falling or being pulled down.
7. All outerwear covering inappropriate clothing as part of an outfit must be worn at all times.
8. Shoes must be worn at all times. All shoes must have sufficient soles to properly protect the feet
from injury (bedroom slippers typically do not have sufficient soles).
9. Hats may be worn in the building but should be taken off during instructional time.
10. Sunglasses are not to be worn in the building.
11. Individual teachers may have more stringent dress requirements for safety reasons within his/her
classroom. Students will be expected to follow said requirements while participating in said
class.

Students are expected to be able to engage in mutually respectful dialogue regarding controversial

issues. Every student has the right to freedom of speech and dress is an important form of ex-
pression. In the event clothing, jewelry, or accessories are worn that result in a disruption of the

educational environment such that students are deprived of their right to education, said articles
of clothing, jewelry, or accessories will be prohibited due to the proven potential for disruption.

Parents of students requiring accommodation for religious beliefs, disabilities, or health con-
cerns should contact the principal. These guidelines should be used to guide student attire at all

times while on school grounds or participating in school-related activities off grounds.

Violations of Dress Code Guidelines
1. Students noted to be violating these guidelines of dress will be asked to correct the violation. No
further action will be taken if student complies.
2. If student is unable to correct the violation on his/her own, the student will be sent to the office
to acquire appropriate clothing from the clothing stocked there for this purpose. No further action
will be taken if student complies.
3. If the student refuses to correct the violation, he/she will be sent to the office for dress guideline

evaluation by the principal(s). If the student is still found to be in violation, he/she will be given an-
other opportunity to correct the violation with his/her own clothing or by choosing something from

the clothing stocked in the office.
4. If the student continues to refuse to correct the violation, the student’s parent/guardian will be
contacted and asked to bring appropriate clothing for the student or arrange transportation for the
student to change into appropriate attire. Student will receive a lunch detention and class time
missed due to leaving school to change clothing or while waiting for clothing to be delivered will
not be excused.

5. If a student acquires more than 3 lunch detentions for violating dress guidelines within a semes-
ter, he/she will receive ISS. The second ISS received for violating dress guidelines will require a

parent/guardian to meet with the principal. Continued infractions will be considered a disciplinary
problem and student will be subject to NCPS disciplinary plan."
"CREEKVIEW H S","TX","https://cfbisd.edu/students-parents/students/studentdocuments/student-parent-handbook/","The Board delegates to the principal the authority to make final determinations as to whether clothing or grooming is or is not within this policy. Parents and students are encouraged to address and resolve concerns related to the Dress & Grooming Policy at the campus level. The principal will assess and determine compliance or non-compliance with the Dress & Grooming Policy and assign corresponding consequences for violation of this policy.  The district’s dress code is established to teach grooming and hygiene, prevent disruptions and minimize safety hazards. After receiving community input and Board approval, some campuses have implemented standardized dress or school uniforms for their students. Campuses with standardized dress or school uniforms will provide specific information to parents related to their clothing requirements.

Parent and Student Responsibility
The parent and student shall be responsible for ensuring that the student is in compliance with all aspects of this policy during the time the student is on school premises during regular school hours. Items worn in violation of this policy may be taken up by a school official and returned according to campus policy Failure by the student to correct dress or grooming violations at first request is considered insubordination and may result in disciplinary action.

Policy Enforcement
It is the responsibility of all professional personnel to administer dress and grooming guidelines. Judgment, with consistent, fair and equitable enforcement of standards, while protecting the dignity of individual students, shall be practiced. Individual campuses may provide specific campus guidelines regarding dress and grooming for their students.

Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD reserves the right to establish rules during the school year regarding new fashions in dress and grooming. Students shall not wear any clothing that, in the principal’s judgment, is startling, unusual, disruptive, and immodest and/or brings undue attention to the student. Students shall not wear any item that is lewd, offensive, vulgar, obscene, or depicts nudity, violence, drugs or alcoholic  beverages. Clothes that raise questions as to whether the clothing item is within the policy may be prohibited. Students’ dress and grooming should not distract other students and/or staff and should contribute to a safe, positive learning environment.

Exclusions
This policy does not prohibit principals from allowing extracurricular group uniforms to be worn on days of special celebrations which involve unusual dress such as “crazy hat day or” 50’s day.

Students are not to dress in a way that presents a health or safety hazard, that constitutes harassment as defined in the district’s harassment policy, or that materially disrupts classwork, causes substantial disorder, or violates the rights of others while on school premises or at school-sponsored functions
Students will not be allowed to wear clothing which declares membership in a group that has as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal acts, or acts that would be criminal if the student were an adult.  For the purpose of this policy, a group is defined as an ongoing organization or association of three or more persons, whether formal or informal that has a common name or a common identifying sign or symbol; and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal activity, intimidation or recruitment of others for such activities.  It has been the experience of the Hudson School District that student dress which signifies or which is likely to be interpreted by other students as signifying membership in such groups calls undue attention to students, causes disruption, and serves to intimidate other students.
The following conditions or restrictions of student dress are subject to health, safety and disruption criteria that show a substantive or material impact on the school environment or individual welfare:  Students will wear clothes that are clean and are not a health risk.  They will dress in a way that does not endanger themselves or others and will wear clothing that covers their stomachs, chests, backs, buttocks and undergarments. Students are required to wear footwear. Shoulder straps are required on all tops.  Students will not wear clothing that is obscene (including obscene items “with double meaning”.)
PROHIBITED ITEMS INCLUDE: Students will not wear clothing that defames, insults, threatens, distracts, harasses or injures any racial or cultural groups or individuals.  Students will not wear clothing that depicts, promotes, or advertises violence, drugs, sex or sexual activity, criminal behavior, or tobacco or nicotine products (including electronic cigarettes).   
In accordance with this policy, building level rules and developmentally appropriate standards will be established and reviewed periodically.  Students, staff and parents shall be informed and educated about the dress code at each of the Hudson School District buildings.
Monitoring and enforcement of the dress code policy will be done in a non-discriminatory way and will not restrict rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.  Monitoring and enforcement of the dress code policy is the responsibility of all school employees.  Disciplinary action associated with the dress code policy is subject to due process and is the responsibility of building administration. Students will be expected to change clothing if found to be out of compliance with the Dress Code.

"MORENCI HIGH SCHOOL","AZ","http://www.morenci.org/phocadownload/HighSchool/Handbook%202018-2019.pdf","Decency in attire is essential because it tends to influence our attitudes and behavior. In matters concerning dress, we realize
that the school community is more sensitive than the general population. We believe it is important for the home and school
to encourage desirable characteristics of student dress. A student’s wardrobe should be conducive to sitting in desks, getting
up and down, bending, and kneeling. Clothing should be neat, clean, inoffensive, decent, and offer protection for all
classroom activities while at Morenci High School. In order to clarify what is considered appropriate, the following has been
developed with faculty and student input:
Shirts / Tops
 Shirt and tank top straps must be approximately 1½” in width or wider.
 No undergarments may be showing at any time (including bra straps); tank tops that abide by the strap width
requirements will not be considered undergarments.
 Sleeveless Shirt underarm openings will be no lower than approximately 3” below the arm pit.
 No strapless, spaghetti straps, tube tops, halter tops, sheer or see-through, backless, one shoulder or off the
shoulder shirts may be worn (unless a garment with appropriate strap width is worn underneath).
 Shirts should not expose skin lower than the shoulder blades.
 Shirts must cover the complete midriff (front and back) when arms are raised.
 Shirts may not be excessively baggy or oversized for a student’s body type.
 Necklines of all tops must be modest (front and back); low-cut necklines are prohibited. Shirts must cover all
visible cleavage (when standing or sitting) and must appropriately cover the chest area (pictures have been
included to give examples of the maximum amount of skin that can be exposed).
Skirts / Dresses
 The tops/upper portion of any dress worn must abide by the requirements outlined in the Shirts/Tops category.
 When seated, skirts and dresses must be at mid-thigh or longer.
Shorts / Pants
 When standing, shorts must reach at least mid-thigh or lower (mid-thigh will be determined from the frontal
view of the bend in the upper leg to the knee.)
 Tops of shorts and pants must be worn at the hips or higher.
Accessories
 Bandanas are not allowed (defined as a large handkerchief).
 Sunglasses may be worn on top of the head as long as they do not become a classroom distraction.
 Headbands may be worn as long as they are worn around the head as intended (defined as an elastic band worn
around the head).
 No spiked jewelry or accessories will be allowed (including jewelry/accessories that can be used as a weapon).
 Shoes must be worn at all times. Defined by footwear having a hard or rubber sole (flip flops are allowed). 
29
 Belts worn with pants and shorts must be worn completely through the belt loops (no dangling ends).
 Hats, including beanies and hoods, are not to be worn in the building. (Exception includes the school
gymnasium and when handling consumables)
All Clothing / Accessories
 Anything worn that displays references to illegal or controlled actions/substances (including tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, drugs, and/or violence etc.) will not be allowed.
 Any combination of clothing which, upon guidance from law enforcement agencies, is considered gang related
(subject to change) i.e. bandanas, hair nets (unless handling consumables), metal belt buckles with gang
monograms, dangling belts, chain accessories, slippers, do-rags etc. is not allowed.
 Anything worn that displays sexually suggestive or provocative wording or images is not allowed (including
clothing and accessories containing the phrase, “I love boobies”).
 Anything worn which displays symbols which reference hatred, hate crimes, violence, anti-social behaviors, or
that offend or intimidate is not allowed.
 Anything worn that has rips, tears, frays, or that is see-through or distressed may not expose any more than what
is outlined in the previous categories.
 Frayed pants or shorts cannot be present or visible above the mid-thigh area (teacher/administrator discretion
will be used to determine the appropriateness of dress).
*Dress code will be more lax during Homecoming weeks, only if students are participating in the approved spirit days.
Limitations and requirements for skin exposure will not be changed.
*During Prom/Dances, the dress code will be more lax; clothes must be conducive to dancing. Dress code will be monitored
by the dance chaperones.
Clothing considered inappropriate but not defined by policy or regulation will be dealt with on an individual basis by the
administration. The dress code may be altered as determined necessary by the administration. Administration will provide
clothing the student is able to change into. If a student refuses to change, the student will be admitted to OCS the same day
and additional consequences may be administered.
Consequences for inappropriate dress:
 1st offense - Warning, not allowed to attend class until properly clothed. Student may call home. Hats will be
confiscated.
 2nd offense - Assigned to OCS for the remainder of the day.
 Repeated offenses - Continue progressive discipline. See Disciplinary Actions
Coaches and club sponsors have authority to impose a dress code for trips and other functions unique to their club. It
is not the intention of Morenci High School to strictly enforce the dress code at formal dances because we recognize that
formal dresses are often strapless or have spaghetti straps. If the dress appropriately covers the body and is not in poor taste,
it will be permissible at formal dances. The administrator and the sponsors who chaperone the dance will be responsible for
making this determination. The dress code will be enforced at all other after school functions. Students not in compliance will
be asked to leave and will be subject to the same disciplinary measures that apply to the regular school day. (Policies JICA,

clothing and/or adornment that advertises alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, controlled substances,
or gang activity. Such attire and/or activity can be potentially life-threatening and is prohibited on
school grounds and at school activities on and off campus. The policy further prohibits the presence of
any apparel including jewelry, accessory, notebook, or manner of grooming which by virtue of its color,

The board expects students to be clean and well groomed and wear clothes in good repair and
appropriate for the time, place and occasion. Clothing or other apparel promoting products illegal for use
by minors and clothing displaying obscene material, profanity, reference to prohibited conduct, or gangrelated
attire or insignia are disallowed. While the primary responsibility for students’ personal
appearance lies with the students and their parents, appearance disruptive to the education program will
not be tolerated. When, in the judgment of a principal, a student’s appearance or mode of dress disrupts
the educational process or constitutes a threat to health or safety, the student may be required to make
modifications.
It shall be the responsibility of the superintendent, in conjunction with the principals, to develop
administrative regulations regarding this policy.
There is a strong connection between academic performance, students' appearance and students'
conduct. Inappropriate student appearance may cause material and substantial disruption to the school
environment or present a threat to the health and safety of students, employees and visitors on school
grounds. Students are expected to adhere to reasonable levels of cleanliness and modesty. Students are
expected to wear clothing that is appropriate to their age level and that does not disrupt the school or
educational environment.
Caps, hats, hoods, bandanas, head gear, book bags, oversized purses, sunglasses, chains, tools, or
other sharp objects that could be dangerous to students or staff or to school property are not to be worn
in the buildings unless designated by the principal on special occasions, (i.e. Homecoming, etc.) The
interpretation of the head gear is left to the discretion of the administration. Clothing which exposes the
midriff is not acceptable as well as backless and strapless clothing. Sling shirts, spaghetti strap shirts,
halter tops, and tube tops will not be worn unless covered by another shirt that is buttoned or zipped for
the day. Items that are torn so to expose bare skin or underclothing will not be worn. Shorts and skirts 
should be an appropriate length. Any clothing deemed disruptive to the educational process by the
administration is prohibited. Administrative discretion will be used in determining what is disruptive to the
educational environment. "

Dress Code enforcement
When a student is wearing clothing items prohibited by the code, he or she is to be informed of the
violation and asked to comply (e.g. remove hat, remove chain). If it is inappropriate to remove the item
or if the student does not comply, the Principal or designee shall be notified by the employee. PCHS staff
members may require that the student add additional clothing (e.g. sweater, jacket) for the remainder of
the day or have the student contact a parent/guardian to bring alternate clothing for the student.
Disciplinary actions shall be taken, as determined appropriate by the Principal or Dean of Students, when
a student continues to violate the code. Refusal of a student to comply with the dress code shall be
considered to be a violation of the Conduct Code and the student shall be subject to suspension and/or
possible expulsion. When a disagreement arises over the appropriateness of student dress, the Principal or
Dean of Students shall make the final decision as to whether the dress is or is not in compliance with this
policy"

Everyone should dress in a way that is respectful to themselves and others and is appropriate and not disruptive to the learning environment. Hats and head coverings are allowed in all common areas (hallways, cafeteria, etc.). The wearing of hats and head coverings in classrooms (except for religious or medical reasons) will be at the discretion of the classroom teacher.
The following list of prohibited items is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather it is intended to provide some idea of acceptable standards of dress.
Halter-tops, crop tops, and tube tops may only be worn with an appropriate top
Sheer or transparent clothing
Slippers and bare feet
Pajamas/sleepwear
Skirts, dresses, or shorts that do not meet at mid-thigh

Items of clothing which reveal undergarments
Items of clothing which reveal excessive cleavage

minimize safety hazards. Students and parents may determine a student’s personal dress and
grooming standards, provided that they comply with the following:
Philosophy
One of Tarkington I.S.D.’s goals for ALL students is that they succeed both academically and
socially and are prepared for the future after they graduate from high school. It is the
philosophy of Tarkington I.S.D. that one’s behavior, actions, and performance are affected by
the way people dress. Appropriate student dress and grooming are important factors in the
orderly operation of the schools. In the future, one certainly will have to follow rules,
regulations, and dress codes of employers and some institutions of higher learning. Therefore,
full cooperation between the home and school is expected.
Violation of the dress code is a Level II offense, according to The Student Code of Conduct.
Additional disciplinary action other than those listed in this policy may be imposed. Failure to
comply with the District’s dress and grooming standards will result in disciplinary action.
This dress code has been established to:
 Reflect the high standards of the community, adhering to good taste, modesty, and
dignity;
 Create an atmosphere of respect for authority, safety, and good personal
hygiene/grooming;
 Promote consistent standards of dress and grooming; and
 Reflect a sense of pride in self, one’s academic achievements, one’s school, and the
District.
The student and his/her parent(s) or guardian may determine the student’s personal dress and
grooming standards provided that the student’s dress and grooming:
 Shall not lead school officials to reasonably believe that such dress or grooming will
disrupt, interfere with, disturb, or detract from school activities; and
 Shall not create a health problem or safety hazard for the student or others.
Using the following guidelines, school administrators, with the input and support of faculty
members, have the final decision in determining and enforcing acceptable student dress and
grooming standards. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically to ensure that they continue
to address the standards of the community and District.
General Guidelines
 Students are not to wear clothing that is tight, loose, revealing, saggy, or short.

minimize safety hazards. Students and parents may determine a student’s personal dress and
grooming standards, provided that they comply with the following:
 We take pride in Rogers I.S.D. and its traditions. One of the most important ways of
doing this is for each one of us to reflect careful and consistent personal habits and
appearance each day. We seek to avoid the fads that are not in keeping with good
grooming. In addition, hairstyles and certain manners of dress that might present a danger to
the student’s health and safety, cause an interference with school work, or create classroom
or school disruption, will not be tolerated. The dress code is in effect for all students when
they are representing the school at any function.
 1. Slogans, pictures, or advertisements, which could disrupt the learning atmosphere,

reach the fingertips, with arms held normally at the side, are acceptable.
 4. Pants, slacks and jeans are permitted, but must fit at the waist, crotch and legs. Pants
that are baggy may not be worn. No sagging will be allowed. Pants, jeans, capris and shorts
may not have any holes above 2 inches from the top of the knee. Pajama style pants will not
be permitted. Appropriate clothing must be worn over tight fitting clothing. Students may
not fix dress code issues with tape or by wearing tights.
 5. All clothes including overalls shall be buttoned appropriately, and belts shall be
buckled. Dangling ends on suspenders, or belts or overalls are not permitted. The waistline
of all clothing must be worn at the waistline of the student. A belt must be used if clothing
will not stay at the waistline. Chains are not to hang from pocket or from billfold to pocket

gang related style/fashion as deemed by the RISD administration. Hoodies will be
considered a cap if the hood is worn over the head.

color may be altered but only with natural type coloring. Colors excluded but not limited to

administration.
 14. A student, who engages in elective extracurricular activities such as band, athletics,
etc., shall comply with the dress and grooming requirements required by the directors of such
activities.
 15. It is the belief of the Rogers School Board and Administration that tattoos should not
be ostentatious, vulgar, depict anything that is not conducive to the educational environment
or distracts other students from learning. Any tattoo that is deemed by the Rogers
Administration to be any of the above will need to be covered. Any questions regarding this
policy will remain with the discretion of the Principal.
If the principal determines that a student’s grooming or clothing violates the school’s dress
code, the student will be given an opportunity to correct the problem at school. If not
corrected, the student may be assigned to in-school suspension for the remainder of the day,
until the problem is corrected, or until a parent or designee brings an acceptable change of
clothing to the school. Repeated offenses may result in more serious disciplinary action in

education is to display proper dress and grooming. It is the responsibility of the parents and the students to ensure
that attire worn to school meets District requirements. This dress code is established to teach grooming and hygiene,
reduce loss of personal property, and teach respect for authority. It should promote the best possible environment

These guidelines must be followed:
What should be covered…
• Clothing that is revealing or displays underwear or the torso is not allowed.
• Clothing should cover and extend half way between the knee and beltline.
• Bandanas are not permitted. Hats are permitted in all common areas, but are at teacher discretion in the classroom.
• Sunglasses are not permitted indoors. Any exception must have medical documentation on record in the office. Clothing should not be worn that is marked or decorated with illustrations of tobacco; alcohol; drugs; sexual
innuendo; word or phrases that are vulgar or obscene or promote behaviors that violate school conduct standards.
This can include “gang” colors or identifying clothing (i.e. ICP garments) if the students are acting in ways that

governing student dress and grooming which are consistent with District policy and regulations. These school dress
codes shall be regularly reviewed.
The following procedures, together with the basic policy, constitute the dress code for the schools:
 1. All school personnel working under the direction of the administration are responsible for providing an
atmosphere on school campuses which is conducive to proper behavior, attitudes, and learning.
 2. All students are expected to wear clothes that are clean, neat, properly fitted, and in good repair. Likewise, all
students are expected to be clean and neat in their grooming. The Board prohibits the presence of any apparel,
 jewelry, accessory, notebook or manner of grooming which, by virtue of its color, arrangement, trademark, or
any other attribute, denotes membership in gangs which advocate drug use, violence, or disruptive behavior.
3. Any manner of dress or grooming which presents a potentially disruptive influence in the school is to be
corrected.
4. Each school administration is to enforce suitable rules and regulations which affect the health and safety of
students in all activities, both instructional and co-curricular. Each school administration shall interpret what is
appropriate according to the rules set forth below.
5. Each school administration may establish more stringent rules for students participating in performing groups,
sports, and other situations where students represent the school in the community.
6. Variations from the basic dress code may be established for special events.
7. The following is a list of items to be used as guidelines in the determination of acceptable dress and grooming
for students.
Presenting a bodily appearance or wearing clothing which is disruptive, revealing, profane, vulgar, offensive or obscene,
or which endangers the health and safety of other students is prohibited. Examples of prohibited dress or appearance
include, but are not limited to:
● Attire that exposes cleavage
● Exposed undergarments/no proper undergarments
● Excessively sagging pants
● Excessively short or tight garments
● Bare midriff shirts/pants
● Strapless shirts
● Attire with messages or illustrations that are lewd, indecent or vulgar
● Attire that advertises products or services not permitted by law to minors
● See-through clothing
● Any adornment such as chains or spikes that could reasonably be perceived as a weapon
● Any symbol, style or attire frequently associated with gangs, intimidation, violence or violent groups
● Headgear of any kind may not be worn in buildings
● Shoes must be worn at all times
The following procedures are guidelines for implementing the policy and the code:
1. Teachers, counselors, or administrators are to make a reasonable attempt to counsel students whose grooming and/or
dress deviates from the dress code.
2. A student who is found to be in violation of the dress code may be sent home or may otherwise be required to
properly prepare himself/herself for school.
3. If the violations continue, contact is to be made with the parents/guardians by the school representative and the
parents/guardians are to be made aware of the failure of the student to conform to the rules and regulations of the
school.
4. Continued violation of the dress code constitutes willful disobedience and is good cause for disciplinary
consequences including detention, Saturday school, in-house suspension, suspension or expulsion from school.
Gang-Related Apparel​ 13
At individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the principal,
staff and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define “gang-related apparel”
and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health and safety of the
school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus. Because gang-related symbols are constantly
changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least once each semester and updated whenever related
information is received. (EC35183)"
"AGWSR HIGH SCHOOL","IA","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynna1BsBpLGYgkXSzQ-MqUJZGIpH7Cdb/view","Students are expected to dress appropriately for school and school activities. Dress and personal appearance should
be safe, healthful, and not interfere with or distract from the educational process.
Personal Appearance
It is expected that students will come to school appropriately dressed. Examples of student apparel that are not
acceptable during school or school-related activities are the following:
1. Caps, hats, bandanas, and other types of ""outdoor"" clothing
2. Shirts or patches worn with obscene or double meaning slogans, sayings, or pictures
3. Shirts or patches that advertise alcohol, tobacco, or other banned substances
4. Halter tops, bare midriff styles or spaghetti straps. (Shirts should have at least 1” wide straps)
5. Apparel that reveals any portion of undergarments
6. Skirts and shorts that are less than the length of the extended arms (including fingers). Interior pockets
should not be visible below the hem.
7. Other items or apparel deemed improper. The principal is responsible for the interpretation of the above guidelines. If at any time student apparel is
judged to constitute a health or safety hazard, be disruptive of the educational process, or is contrary to community
standards and values, students will be asked to modify their appearance to an acceptable level.

If in doubt, don't wear it!

Parents are urged to monitor student dress and assist the child in making appropriate decisions. General cleanliness
of body and clothing is of the utmost importance. Studies show there is a direct relationship between the type of
clothing worn and the way children conduct themselves.
Iowa’s educational standards require that students from grades one through twelve be taught the effects of alcohol,
tobacco, drugs and poisons on the human body as part of their health and physical education. Any message
depicting the use of alcohol or drugs runs counter to our educational mission. While the primary responsibility for
appearance rests with the students and their parents, the administration reserves the right to judge what is proper
and what is not. Please carefully screen t-shirt communication. We stress the importance of communicating with
each other in a respectful manner and some t-shirts do not support that effort.
Students will not be allowed to wear any type of headgear (caps, hats, headbands, or bandanas) in educational areas
and the lunchroom. Students will be asked to promptly remove their headgear when they enter the building. Short
shirts that allow the exposure of the midriff in either boys or girls will not be allowed."

or change out of clothing that is unacceptable for reasons stated above. IVHS maintains a selection of
used but clean clothing for students who violate the dress code. Parents will be called to bring
alternative clothing if necessary. Examples of unacceptable dress include:
● Clothing that depicts drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sexual acts, nudity or partial nudity,
profanity or that in any way demeans others(i.e. race, gender, sexual orientation). This
includes logos such as the SKIN brand with the silhouettes of a nude female body. Also
any marijuana leaf or depiction of such is prohibited. Hats or clothing with the TITS

"GRIFFIN HIGH SCHOOL","GA","http://www.griffinhighschool.org/About/Dress-Code/index.html","The Griffin-Spalding County School System dress code requires students in middle and high school to dress in a manner that is conductive to a good learning environment.  Our behavior patterns are affected by what we wear.  When students are wearing proper attire, they are more reserved in their behavior.  Visitors and our community judge our schools by the appearance and deportment of our students.  Our impressions upon others and the impressions of the entire school are influenced by what students wear.

One objective of a school is to assist students in preparing for life in the business and social worlds.  Our schools, therefore, should help students learn to dress in a manner the public finds appropriate.  Many fads in dress are not appropriate for school.  Therefore, students’ dress should reflect neatness, cleanliness and should not distract or cause disruption in the educational process of school.

The school administration reserves the right to determine if a student’s dress, hairstyle, etc. are too casual, too revealing, or too distracting in the learning environment to be considered appropriate for school.  The safety of all students will be taken into consideration when making decisions regarding appropriate/inappropriate attire including the tucking in of shirt tails.

It is not the intent of this regulation to create hardship or stress on any student or parent, but rather to provide a reasonable standard of dress.  Recognizing the fact that no dress code is perfect and there may be some who will not agree on all points, we are requesting the cooperation of all students and their parents in adhering to this policy.  The following restrictions, therefore, are imposed:

During school hours or at school activities, students should wear appropriate footwear.   (Flip flops and bedroom shoes are not appropriate.)
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not wear clothing with slit(s) or hole(s).  (Frayed area(s) and patched holed are not appropriate.)
During school hours or at school activities, students may wear skirts, shorts, skorts, or dresses that fall below fingertip length when arms are held loosely at the side.
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not wear tank shirts, halter tops, shirts or dresses with spaghetti straps.   In addition, tops that expose cleavage, the midriffs, strapless dresses or see-through clothing are not appropriate during school hours or at school activities.
During school hours or at school activities, tails of shirts shall be worn at wrist level or above.  Shirts longer than this must be tucked. During school hours or at school activities, students shall wear pants belted at the natural waistline. There will be no “busting slack” or exposure of clothing designed and sold as undergarments during school hours.
During school hours or at school activities, students may not wear oversized clothing, skin-tight pants, or form fitting clothing.  Students may wear leggings provided a dress or top is worn over the leggings.  The length of the dress or top worn over the leggings must fall below the fingertip length when arms are held loosely at the side.
During school hours or at school activities, students may not wear clothing in a manner inconsistent with the intended design (Examples: bandanas used as belts, etc.).
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not wear clothing displaying obscene or suggestive slogans or shirts with pictures or patches displaying illegal substances for minors. (Examples: symbols of drugs, tobacco products or alcoholic beverages, etc.)
During School hours or at school activities, students shall not wear clothing which displays or implies profane, vulgar, obscene or racially offensive language, symbols, or sexual innuendo.
During school hours or at school activities, students shall not display emblems, insignias, writing graphics, pictures, badges, tattoos or other symbols where the effect is to cause disruption or interference with the operation of the school.

clothing is expected to be in good taste, neat and clean. Clothing choices should provide for a safe
environment for all students. The Little Miami School District is committed to providing students a
quality education in an environment that prepares them for life after graduation. These standards of
dress have been established to ensure such an environment where learning and preparation for the
future are the top priorities.
Students will be permitted to wear apparel considered appropriate, reflecting ideals consistent with
and promoting the realities of good education. The building administrator may exclude any student

worn inside the building.
2. Appropriate footwear must be worn and provide for safe and sanitary conditions.

"JEFFERSON HIGH","WI","https://www.sdoj.org/cms_files/resources/JHS%20Handbook%2018-19%20Final%20updates%206-25-18.pdf"," Jefferson High School prides itself as being a place where
students can enjoy their freedom to get involved in many activities, choose their classes of
interest, and express their individuality. Although we respect a student’s right to make
these choices, we also need to set appropriate standards.
In light of recent trends in dress, we, as an educational institution, feel the need to
establish a more specific dress code to limit the definition of clothing that is appropriate
for our educational setting. As always, garments bearing offensive words or offensive
slogans including references to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, gangs or sexual activity are not
allowed. Hats and other headgear (other than for religious and/or medical purposes), such
as, visors, hoods, or bandannas/headbands on the forehead, are not to be worn in the school
building. These items should be kept in your locker during the school day. This excludes;
pony tail holders, hair clips, and hair accessories with the purpose of keeping hair out of
students’ eyes. Building Administrators will have the final decision-making authority in all
matters related to the dress code.
The following additional guidelines have been established.
1. No bare midriffs, open-back shirts, halter tops, strapless shirts, spaghetti straps,
or single strap shirts may be worn. All shirts must have straps that are at least 2
inches thick. All shirts must cover the back, stomach, and cleavage.
2. Very short mini-skirts, dresses, or shorts are not appropriate for school. Length
of garment must be at or below longest finger with relaxed arms at your side.
3. Pants worn in such a way that undergarments are visible will not be allowed.
Neither wallet nor hip chains should be worn at school.
4. No coats may be worn in the classroom. In case of colder than usual classrooms,
students should be prepared with appropriate clothing.
5. Gang-affiliated jewelry or dress of any kind will not be allowed.
6. No Articles of clothing, or other apparel will be worn that would be deemed
messages of hate, harassment of any manner that addresses another individual’s
race, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ethnicity,
religion, cultural observance, or socioeconomic environment.
We appreciate your support in helping to maintain a safe and effective educational
environment at Jefferson High School. "

world of work.
While dress choices are a reflection of student individuality and style, clothing that is inappropriate,
offensive, or distracting to the learning process is not allowed at CGBHS. CGBHS expects all students to be
neat, clean, and dressed in good taste. Clothing must not be too short, not too tight, and clothing must
cover areas that are expected to be covered with no undergarments to be exposed. Footwear is expected to
be worn at all times.
This is not an exhaustive list and CGBHS administration may amend this policy during the school year if
needed. Any adjustment of the dress code will be communicated with students and parents. Unacceptable
clothing that distracts from the learning environment may include, but is not limited to the following:
● Drug, alcohol, or tobacco representations
● Profanity or inappropriate language
● Images, symbols, or language that is considered derogatory to any group of people
● Hats, hoodies, sun visors, and/or headgear for outdoor wear (the wearing of headwear for medical
or religious reasons is permitted. Headwear is also allowed for specific spirit wear days.)
● Any clothing which does not cover a student’s undergarments, shows midriff and/or cleavage, or any
other areas of the body that expose too much bare skin.
● Jackets and backpacks must be placed in student lockers and remain in lockers until the end of
school.
The use of common sense in the matter of personal grooming and wearing of clothing is the best criteria to
follow. Cedar Grove-Belgium requests that all parents/guardians take an active interest in their students’
appearance before they leave for school so that the student and those around the student can fully
concentrate on the work at hand.
Students in violation of this dress code will be given the following options:
● Students will be asked to fix the violation by changing or adjusting their clothing.
● Parents will be contacted to bring appropriate clothing to school.
● CGBHS administration will provide appropriate clothing for the student to wear.
● The student will be assigned to an in-school suspension room until the clothing violation is resolved."

We also recognize that clothing choices are a very personal matter and a way that our students express themselves, reflect their individual personalities, and exercise their freedom.  However, we also must balance individual freedom with maintaining an appropriate learning environment.  Though we have adapted to changing styles over the years, there are certain clothing items that are considered inappropriate attire for school.
 
In preparation for the adult world, we would like for our students to develop an understanding that appropriate attire is different for social activities/gatherings, a date, the gym, the beach/pool, work, school, etc.  We believe that appropriate attire for school should more closely resemble the adolescent workplace standard.  

Specific clothing specifications at CHS include (but are not limited to) the following:

1. Shorts and skirts/dresses must be appropriate for school.  An appropriate length may be approximated by the fingertips of a fully stretched arm.  

2. Undergarments should not be visible through clothing and  must be covered at all times.

3. Hats/hoods must be removed upon entering the building.

4. Shirts must have straps over the shoulders and need to cover the entire stomach, midriff, chest, and back.

5. All messages and pictures displayed on clothing should be appropriate in nature.  See MCPS Policy 7-3.1

If attire does not meet dress code, students will be given an opportunity to comply and attend class.

- Administration may deem other clothing 
and attire inappropriate, even if not expressly stated above -

individualism. Fundamental responsibility for standards of dress and grooming rests with the student and his/her parent or
guardian. All students are expected to wear clean, appropriate and reasonably well-fitting clothing. Please remember that your
personal appearance is a reflection of who and what you are. Students should wear clothes appropriate for their body type.
Dressing in a promiscuous manner or displaying nude body parts is unacceptable. It is also important to realize that the school will
not permit clothing that is inappropriate or clothing that interferes with the school day.
EXPECTATIONS
1. DRESS. ​Clothing must not be too tight, too short, too sheer, or too revealing whether standing or seated. This includes
tights, spandex, exercise pants and/or leggings as deemed inappropriate by an administrator. If you chose to wear these

they meet this criteria. Cleavage must not be showing and the neckline covered as deemed appropriate by an
administrator.

Garments that are “see-through,” cut low, or expose one’s midriff are not acceptable. Sleeveless
garments must extend to the end of the shoulders and fit closely under the arms. Clothing should

Students shall not wear clothing that display messages that are vulgar, offensive, obscene, or
libelous; that demean others on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, national origin, gender,
sexual orientation, or disability; that promote alcohol or drug use or violence; or that are otherwise
contrary to the school’s educational mission.
Sagging Pants
Students shall not wear pants that, when fastened, sag or fit below the waist. All pants must fit around
the waist and be properly fastened.
Gang-Related Attire
Any attire or grooming deemed to be gang related is prohibited when such attire or grooming creates

safety.
• Body piercing that is a safety hazard and/or hinders performance in a classroom is not allowed.

dress code but may add other restrictions if the school administration deems it necessary. If a
student or parent has any questions about whether specific attire or accessories are in compliance
with the dress code, they should contact an Assistant Principal at their school site prior to wearing
such attire or accessories to ensure compliance.
Administrator Discretion
The school administration retains the final discretion to determine that the garment or accessory
meets the dress code. Some exceptions may be made for uniforms, formal attire, and/or costumes.

Consequences

the school. All students should strive for high standards of achievement
through hard work, initiative and collaboration. In addition, we seek to
foster an atmosphere of acceptance and open-mindedness, in which
students practice empathy and find common ground. With this in mind,
Student dress and appearance should be appropriate for the business of
school. Therefore, students are expected to exercise good judgment in
selecting school attire.
Any clothing, accessory, hairstyle or grooming habit that is a danger to
student health/safety may not be permitted and student dress should not
hinder participation in a given class (for instance, PE or a chemistry lab).
Also, student dress that is obscene or offensive, and/or disruptive to the
learning environment will not be permitted. All students are expected to
dress appropriately during the school day and at all school-sponsored
events.
Prohibited Attire/Protocols:
A. Hoods, sunglasses, bandanas, hats and any other head/face
covering may be worn with the permission of the building
administration and staff. Students are expected to comply with teacher or
staff requests to remove such items in classrooms.
B. Articles which display drug, alcohol, or tobacco logos or
depict use of the same
C. Articles which display messages, illustrations or symbols
that are lewd, indecent, offensive or vulgar
D. Articles which display racial, religious or gender slurs
E. Clothing that reveals or fails to cover undergarments
F. Bare feet
Participation in team dress up or school spirit days does not excuse
students from abiding by the dress code.
Students whose dress violates the code may be required to
modify (i.e. cover, remove or change) their appearance. Refusal may
result in a range of disciplinary consequences, including parent phone
calls or detentions. Student dress code enforcement should not result in
unnecessary barriers to school attendance. With our core values in mind, all students should be able to dress
comfortably for school and engage in learning without fear of body
shaming or being singled out in front of peers. Reasons for conflict and
inconsistent/inequitable discipline should be minimized whenever
possible. Teachers should be allowed to focus on teaching without the
additional burden of dress code enforcement. Teacher with specific
student concerns should forward them to an assistant principal."

provide students the opportunity to practice dress and grooming requirements needed for future job
employment.

Appropriate wearing of apparel and cleanliness of person is important as a matter of health and aesthetics, as
well as being conducive to learning. With the rapidly changing styles of clothing, it is impossible to specify
everything that is acceptable for student dress. A good rule to follow is that if there is doubt concerning the
appropriateness of your clothes for school, DO NOT wear them until you check.
Dress code violations will be handled through the school discipline policy. Students who come to school
dressed inappropriately must change clothes to meet the school dress code before returning to class. Repeated
violations of dress code will result in discipline action. In order to preserve discipline and order in the school
and create a proper and safe learning environment, the following dress code will be enforced:
Girls
For girls, dresses, skirts, jeans, shorts, and slacks are appropriate for school wear. For attire regarding length:
Shorts, dresses, and skirts shall be no more than one business card (2”) above the knee. Sheer apparel,
bare midriffs and /or backs, very low necklines (no cleavage), extremely tight garments, strapless tops, tank
tops, and spaghetti straps are not permissible. Skin-tight pants, such as jeggings, leggings, yoga pants, etc.,
may only be worn when otherwise permissible clothing (no more than one business card above the knee) is
worn over them. Undergarments should not be visible at any time.
Boys
For boys, jeans, slacks, shorts, sport shirts, jerseys, and tee shirts are appropriate. Tank tops or sleeveless
shirts ARE NOT appropriate. Shorts shall be no more than one business card (2”) above the knee.
Button type shirts should be properly closed, and belts must be buckled around the natural waistline.
Undergarments should not be visible at any time.
Girls and Boys
No pants and/or jeans may be worn that are ripped, torn or frayed where skin and/or undergarments may be
exposed above the knee. No racerback tops of any type are permitted. No tinting, streaking, or dying of
hair to unnatural hair colors is permitted without administrative approval. Hair must be worn appropriately so
it does not interfere with students’ vision or the teachers’ and/or administrators’ ability to maintain eye
contact. Contact lenses that alter students’ eyes to unnatural colors/designs are prohibited.
No hoods, hats, caps, sunglasses, chokers or bracelets that could be harmful, or any head covering will be
worn on school campus unless for religious or medical purposes except when approved by the administration.
Other prohibited items include: (1) large, long, and /or heavy chains, (2) studded or chained accessories, and
(3) sleepwear, including bedroom slippers, blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, etc. Shoes must be worn at all
times.

tobacco or illegal products will be permitted. Clothing that suggests gang affiliation, non-sanctioned clubs, or
racially offensive subject matter will not be tolerated. Caps/hats/hoods/bandanas may not be worn in the
school building.
No visible body piercing (other than ears) will be allowed. No tongue piercing is allowed. Gang related
markings or tattoos or any other distraction that is detrimental to the educational environment will not be
permitted. Visible drawings/markings are not permitted on student’s skin (markers, etc.).

So let’s be honest -- what are really the current issues at South Albany?
The biggest issues we have at South Albany in terms of dress code are
 Our gentlemen wearing pants/shorts that are sagging--sharing their underwear with everyone
 Our young ladies wearing tops that are strapless, plunge or are low cut and draw attention to their
chest
 Our young ladies wearing tops that expose their underwear or mid-drift (stomach)
 Very short shorts seem to come out in the nice weather (rule is mid-thigh length)
 Once in a while, we get bandanas or other gang associated clothing
 From there, we have a small number of other items on the “don’t list” below
The following pages are from a PRIDE Team presentation that describes the expectations and
encourages students to show their RedHawks Pride through their choice of apparel.
“The Do NOT List” -- Unacceptable Dress and Appearance: The following types of clothing and
accessories will not be permitted at school and/or school sponsored activities:
 Clothing or material which represent or advertise tobacco, alcohol or any controlled substances

 No sleepwear or slippers
 No hoods on in classrooms
 No headphones in classroom unless a specific time has been approved by the teacher 
Students who are dressed inappropriately will be given an opportunity to change to appropriate attire.

inappropriate clothing will be considered “defiance” and will earn consequences.
Wearing, possessing, using, displaying or selling of any clothing, jewelry, emblem, badge, symbol, sign
or other thing which is evidence of membership, affiliation or support of any gang will not be allowed.

• No pajamas or skimpy lounge wear allowed. Clothing with holes or tears that reveal too much as deemed by the principal will also be unacceptable.
• Students should bring warm enough clothing (i.e. sweatshirt, sweaters, etc.) for them to adapt to the variable temperature of a large building. For
safety reasons (i.e. the ability to conceal materials), coats/jackets will not be allowed in classrooms.
• Clothing must cover all undergarments completely at all times for both male and female students. Mini-skirts, short-shorts, and saggy pants are
prohibited. Student tops that are worn must have straps, cover the front, sides and back of the upper body (from the middle of the shoulder blades
down at a minimum, and meet (touch) the pants (trousers, jeans, shorts, skirt) at the waist when the student is standing straight and tall).
• No students will be allowed to wear any clothing which is identified with gangs or gang-related activities (e.g., gang-related colors, insignias,
hats/caps, jackets, bandanas tied on clothing, etc.)
It is recommended that students dress moderately to avoid problems, remembering that this is a school and by the nature of the environment a certain type/quality of dress is required. Students found in violation of these administrative rules will be asked to change into approved attire immediately. Students should not anticipate using school time to fix dress code violations. If students have to go home to change, they will be charged the time gone as unexcused and given detention time to make up for the lost instructional minutes. Repeated violations may be punished by suspension. This policy shall be enforced during the regular school day and at all school-sponsored activities."

Students in Non-compliance:

Student will be given the opportunity to obtain appropriate dress and student warning will be issued. Should the Administrator determine that a student’s non-compliance with the EHHS Dress Code is an act of insubordination, disciplinary action will be taken.

A student who is groomed or attired in a manner that is detrimental to and/or distracts from the school environment shall be required to make arrangements for more suitable or appropriate dress.
If the arrangement for more suitable or appropriate dress requires the student
to be absent from class, the student will remain in ISD until he/she is groomed and/or dressed according to policy. The time spent in ISD may or may not count toward punishment for the dress code violation.
School administrators retain the right to enforce dress code policy at school-sponsored events on or off campus.

"LAKER HIGH SCHOOL","MI","https://lakerschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/STUDENT-HANDBOOK-2018-2019.pdf","Rationale: The purpose of Laker Secondary Schools is to be a place where students can learn. Our goal is to help students to become productive citizens in the community, in the world of work, and in higher education. To prepare for these roles, students must dress and present themselves to others in an appropriate manner that reflects self-respect. In the world of work, how we present our- selves is important and dress codes are commonplace. The same standards apply at school. Dressing appropriately sets the tone for learning and eliminates distractions.
While fashion changes, the reason for attending school does not. Students are enrolled to learn, and the integrity of the teaching/ learning process is of paramount importance. Thus, students are expected to dress in a manner that is neither distracting nor dis- ruptive to the educational process. Although personal expression is valued and student dress is a parental responsibility, school per- sonnel will confer with students and parents, and/or take corrective measures as necessary in instances in which dress and grooming are dangerous to safety, detrimental to good health, or so distract- ing as to interfere with the teaching and learning process.
Dress Code Regulations: The following are the regulations for students at Laker Secondary Schools.
We expect:
1. all students to wear clothing that is appropriate for school. 2. parents to see that students have acceptable grooming and
dress prior to their attending classes.
3. shirts and blouses to cover the skin and not expose undergar-
ments, cleavage, lower back and abdomen. While standing straight up with your arms outstretched to the side and parallel to the floor, if bare skin shows in the midriff area front or back, the top is too short and should be changed.
4. slacks, pants, skirts, shorts, sweatpants and warm-ups to be worn around the waistline.
5. skirts and shorts to be knee length. They may be worn all year long.
6. students at all times are to wear appropriate foundation gar- ments and under clothing that is not visible to onlookers.
We will not allow students to:
1. attend school if their personal hygiene or clothing endangers their own health or safety or that of others, or interferes in any way with the educational process.
2. wear clothing that displays degrading or obscene language; clothing with pictures or slogans of alcohol, weapons, drugs, or tobacco-related products; clothing with slogans/pictures containing sexual innuendo.
3. wear or display any apparel that is gang related or to wear any items affiliated with hate groups.
4. wear hats, sweatbands or headgear in the building during school hours.
5. wear sunglasses in the building unless the student submits a doctor’s note to the office.
6. wear see-through clothing or spandex-like clothing, unless worn beneath another appropriate garment.
7. clothing with holes that reveal skin above the knee.
8. wear pajamas, bedroom slippers, or blankets
9. wear spikes, chains or sharp objects.
10. wear tank tops, unless they are part of a school uniform (ie.
softball), or worn beneath another appropriate garment.
Dress Code Violations:
1. Students in violation of this policy will be sent to the office by a staff member for correction of the violation.
2. The office will have t-shirts and sweatpants for students to borrow. If a change in attire cannot be accomplished at school, the student will be sent home to make the necessary adjustment (s). If a student is sent home to change, she/he is expected to return to school wearing appropriate clothing.
3. Students who continually violate this policy will face disciplinary action.
4. The building administrator will make the final decision in any
case."

Neatness, good taste and proper dress are as much a part of the teaching-learning process as your classes. It is apparent that styles of clothing, as well as hair styles change. The principles of cleanliness, neatness and good grooming still apply. Cleanliness and good grooming do not mean expensive clothing. The Code of Dress pertains to the apparel worn during the regular school day and to school functions. Any clothing or personal appearance that creates a disruption to the normal school day is prohibited.
1. A student should be clean, neat and well-groomed.
2. A student should not wear any suggestive apparel, obscene signs or writing which
would be offensive or vulgar.
3. A student should not wear clothing that is excessively loose or tight.
4. A student should not wear or dress in any manner which will disrupt the normal
operation of the school. This includes any hair color, unusual and or disruptive hairstyle or cut deemed inappropriate by the Asher Board of Education and the administration.
5. Hats, caps, bandanas, and scarves (covering head) are not to be worn in the buildings or classrooms. .
6. Shirts and blouses are to be buttoned up the front. No bare midriff (front or back).
7. Shorts and skirts should be no shorter than mid-thigh when standing. (This
rule is for grades above the 4th grade, not including gym class.)
8. Undergarments, leggings or tights must be appropriately covered by
outerwear.
9. Students must wear shoes or sandals, and no bare feet. Flip flops and shower shoes will be permissible. House shoes are not permissible!!
10. Pajama pants or pajamas are not permissible unless it is a designated “Pajama Day.” In the event of “Pajama Day”, pajamas must adhere to dress code.

Boys may have ONLY ONE earring in the ear only and one other visible body piercing.
12. Sleeves must measure at least three fingers across the width of shoulders. No spaghetti straps.
13. Absolutely no trench coats of any kind may be worn at any time on school. campus or facilities; nor at any school sponsored activity. (Away sporting events, contests or organization competitions)
Any violation of the above codes will result in the day being spent in ISS. Any violation noticed after lunch will result in the remainder of the day and the following day in ISS. Students will not be allowed to go home to change or have parents bring them clothes. Asher School Administration may revise the dress code at any time deemed necessary."
"LODI HIGH","WI","https://www.lodi.k12.wi.us/cms_files/resources/2018-19%20LHS%20Full%20PS%20Handbook.pdf","The School District of Lodi understands that individuals like to dress in a wide variety of fashions and styles. We support the right of individuals to dress as they desire within the principles and limits as outlined below:
Students are expected to dress in a manner appropriate to a learning and work environment at all times during the school day and at school events. Attire should not be offensive, obscene, disruptive, represent a gang, or endanger other student’s health or safety. Footwear must be worn. Midriffs must be covered at all times. Underwear should not be exposed. All clothing should completely cover the appropriate body parts when walking, running, reaching, stooping, sitting, and bending over. Jackets and head gear (hats, caps, visors, bandanas, etc.) including hoods will not be worn in the building during the school day. Any apparel that promotes alcohol, drugs, tobacco, violence and or sexually explicit material is forbidden. Student dress and grooming may be more strictly regulated for voluntary activities such as athletics, field trips, band, chorus and other areas where safety is a concern such as technical education, family and consumer science, physical education, and science labs. The guidelines below may not cover all situations. The administration reserves the right to make judgments on items listed below, as well as in areas not specifically addressed in this policy. The dress code applies to all school events.
 Clothing must be decent and not overly revealing, especially in regard to bare midriffs, low-cut tops, and underwear. Therefore LHS will use an “at rest” standard, meaning that if the clothing covers these areas while a student is “at rest,” the clothing will generally not violate this standard. Shirts must have two straps sewn securely (no halters, ties, or tube tops).
 Shorts and skirts must cover legs judged by the “at rest” standard, i.e., when the student’s hands hang at his/her sides, the student’s thumb cannot touch skin.
 Clothing must reflect our school as a place that strives to be alcohol, drug, and harassment free. Therefore clothing cannot advertise or promote alcohol, drugs, tobacco, bars, strip clubs, etc. Clothing cannot contain obscenities, or make reference to sexual activity, in either an overt or double-meaning message.
 Clothing must be safe. Therefore chains, spiked items, bandanas, headgear, and gang-related items are prohibited. Bandanas worn around the neck or uniform related will be allowed. Footwear must be worn at all times.
 Teacher-student eye contact is a fundamental part of education; therefore hats and hoods are not allowed during the school day and should be stored in lockers. Hats and hoods need to be removed upon entering the building. Sunglasses and contact lenses that hide eyes are prohibited at all times.
 Students are expected to come to class ready to learn. Wearing coats to class can instead imply that students are ready to leave; therefore students are not to wear coats to class.
For most first offenses, students will be asked to change out of or remove the item that is in violation of the above standards. Second and subsequent violations will result in the student being sent home from school with an unexcused absence and discipline as necessary for lost instruction time."

Students are expected to be clean and dressed in good taste. Shoes must be worn at all times. Shirts must be buttoned and side buttons on overalls must be buttoned. Sleeveless shirts should fit snug at the shoulder, under the arm and be hemmed. Walking shorts and mini-skirts may be worn but meet the length requirement of hands at side with fingers extended and still touching cloth. These must be in good taste. Unacceptable appearance: muscle shirts, see-through tops, halter tops, tops that do not touch the lower garment at all times (thus exposing the bare midriff skin), tops with excessively low necklines and clothing with writing or pictures which are suggestive or symbolic of drugs, alcohol, sex, tobacco or anything illegal or immoral. Exposed undergarments and/or excessively tight-fitting clothes may not be worn to school.
Jewelry that is worn by piercing the body may be worn on the student’s ear. This is a common form of attire that does not attract undue attention or impose significant risk to student health. However, jewelry that is worn by means of piercing other body parts than the ear is not to be worn at school. Examples include piercing of the tongue, the nose, and eyelids. Such jewelry may pose a potential danger to students because of its location on the front of the face and may present a distraction to students or teachers during class time. Students who wear jewelry not permitted by this policy will be asked to remove such items and leave them in the care of the principal’s office until after school. Students who refuse to remove such items will be subject to discipline.
In keeping with the high standards of good grooming and behavior, each individual student will be responsible for maintaining personal cleanliness. Hair will be kept out of the eyes so vision is not impaired. Hats, scarves, and sunglasses are not to be worn inside any building or gym. Hair color should be a natural color such as brown, black, blonde, etc. No hair will be colored blue, purple, green, etc. The teacher will document with building principal dress code violations (example: sagging pants, if the student has to be told to pull them up, the teacher shall inform building principal to establish documentation).

"OKAY HS","OK","https://s3.amazonaws.com/scschoolfiles/621/2017-2018_hs_handbook_20.pdf","Generally, students should regard neatness and cleanliness in grooming and clothing as important.

The principal, in conjunction with sponsors, coaches, or other persons in charge of extracurricular activities, may regulate dress and grooming of students who participate in a particular activity if the principal reasonably believes that the student’s dress or grooming creates a hazard, or may prevent, interfere with, or adversely affect the purpose, direction, or effort required for the activity to achieve its goals.
If a student’s dress or grooming is objectionable under the above provisions, the principal shall require the student to make appropriate corrections before returning to class. If the student declines to make the corrections to clothing, the principal shall notify the student’s parents or legal guardians and request that they provide appropriate clothing immediately. If the parent or legal guardian is unable to comply or refuses, the principal shall take appropriate disciplinary action.
Students who violate provisions of the dress code and who refuse to correct the violation may be disciplined by removal or exclusion from extracurricular activities or suspended from school.

"WASHTENAW INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL","MI","https://www.wihi.org/uploads/8/9/2/8/8928442/studentguide_18-19.pdf","The student dress code was developed by WIHI students, staff, parents, and administrators to
provide guidance for student dress while simultaneously allowing students to express
themselves through clothing. Student dress codes should support equitable educational access
and should not reinforce gender stereotypes. Student dress codes and administrative
enforcement should not reinforce or increase marginalization or oppression of any group based
on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, household income, gender identity, size
or cultural observance.
This Dress Code is modeled after the Oregon NOW dress code and has been specifically created
collaboratively with students, parents, staff, and administrators to promote a safe, inclusive, and
equitable school culture.
Our values are:
● All students and staff should understand that they are responsible for managing their
own personal actions without regulating the clothing/self expression of others.
● All students and families are responsible for determining what is and is not appropriate
clothing for school while adhering to the school dress code.
● All students should be able to dress comfortably for school without unnecessary
discipline or body shaming, or the fear thereof.
● Teachers can focus on teaching without the additional burden of dress code
enforcement.
● Students should not face unnecessary barriers to school attendance.
● Reasons for conflict and inconsistent discipline should be minimized whenever possible.
I. GOALS OF A STUDENT DRESS CODE:
A student dress code should accomplish several goals:
● Maintain a safe learning environment in classes where protective or supportive
clothing is needed, such as chemistry/biology (eye or body protection), or PE
(athletic attire/shoes).
● Allow students to wear clothing of their choice that is comfortable.
● Allow students to wear clothing that expresses their self-identified gender.
● Allow students to wear religious attire without fear of discipline or discrimination.
● Prevent students from wearing clothing with offensive images or language,
including profanity, hate speech, and pornography.
● Prevent students from wearing clothing with images or language depictingor
advocating violence, or the use of alcohol or drugs.
● Prevent students from wearing clothing that reveals private parts and areas
● Ensure that all students are treated equitably regardless of gender/gender identification,
sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, body type/size, religion, and personal style.
II. RECOMMENDED DRESS CODE POLICY:
The primary responsibility for a student’s attire resides with the student and parents or
guardians. The school district and individual schools are responsible for seeing that student
attire does not interfere with the health or safety of any student, and that student attire does not
contribute to a hostile or intimidating atmosphere for any student. Students should be given the
most choice possible in how they dress for school. Any restrictions must be necessary to support
the overall educational goals of the school and must be explained within the dress code.
Basic Principle: Certain body parts must be covered for all students
Clothes must be worn in a way such that genitals, buttocks, and majority of chest are covered
with opaque material. All items listed in the “must wear” and “cannot wear” categories below
must meet this basic principle.
Students MUST Wear
● Shirt.
● Bottom: pants/ sweat pants/ shorts/ skirt/ dress/ leggings
● Shoes; activity-specific shoes requirements are permitted (for example for sports)
*High-school courses that include attire as part of the curriculum (for example,
professionalism, public speaking, and job readiness) may include assignment-specific dress, but
should not focus on covering girls’ bodies or promoting culturally-specific attire.
Students CANNOT Wear
● Violent language or images.
● Images or language depicting drugs or alcohol (or any illegal item or activity) or the use
of same.
● Hate speech, profanity, pornography.
● Images or language that creates a hostile or intimidating environment based on any
protected class.
● Visible underwear.
● Bathing suits.
● Helmets or headgear that obscures the face (except as a religious observance).
III. TRAINING FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS & STUDENTS
A school dress code is most effective when school administrators and teachers are trained to
understand and embrace the intent of the code, how to apply and enforce the code equitably,
and how to talk about the dress code and the reasoning behind it.
● School administrators and teachers should be trained to understand the purpose/spirit
of the code, the actual code, and how to enforce with the least impact on student learning
and self-confidence.
● School administrators and teachers must enforce the district dress code consistently,
once it is adopted. School administration and staff should not have discretion to vary the
requirements in ways that lead to discriminatory enforcement.
● School staff should be trained and able to use student/body-positive language to explain
the code and to address code violations respectfully and when possible privately.
IV. DRESS CODE ENFORCEMENT AT SCHOOLS
A school dress code is only as effective and fair as its enforcement. Historically school dress
codes have been unintentionally written and enforced in ways that disproportionately impact
girls, students of color, and gender expansive students.
Enforcement should be consistent with a school’s overall commitment to studentcentered
learning, focused mission and should not result in discipline unless the student
is refusing to adjust clothing and being insubordinate.
● Students should never be removed from a classroom / lose class time solely as a result of
a dress code violation with the exception of a brief private conversation regarding dress
code violation.
● Students should never be forced to wear extra school clothing when they are in violation
of the code. They can be asked to put on their own clothing or a friend’s clothing, if
available, to be dressed according to the dress code.
● Students’ parents will never be called during the school day to bring alternative clothing
for the student to wear for the remainder of the day.
● No student should be disproportionately affected by dress code enforcement because of
gender, race, body size, or body maturity.
● The dress code should be clearly conveyed to students, not just in the student
handbook, but also in dean emails, and reminder announcements.
● Students should not be shamed or required to display their body in front of others
(students, parents, or staff) in school. “Shaming” includes but is not limited to kneeling
or bending over to check attire fit, measuring straps or skirt length, asking students to
account for their attire in the classroom, and directing students to correct a dress code
violation during instructional time."

The Andrews Independent School District is charged with the responsibility of maintaining an
atmosphere conducive to learning. Meeting this responsibility entails providing not only a secure
educational environment but also teaching standards of acceptable behavior and appearance among
students. Experience shows that student success depends in part on how the student perceives
himself/herself and how others perceive him/her. In this sense, defined standards of appearance
assist the student in constructing a positive self-image and impression upon others.
It is not the intention of these regulations to take the prerogatives of parents of determining what is
appropriate dress and grooming for their children in accordance with their age and grade. Of
paramount importance in the design of this code is concern for the health and safety of the students,
teaching dress and grooming choices appropriate to the environment, and to maintain an educational
environment that is free from distractions or disruptions.
The principal/assistant principal shall have the authority to appraise any current fashion or fad and
determine whether it is appropriate for school wear. The school shall have the right to ask students to
change their attire if it is of such a nature that it provokes unfavorable comment, or if it leads school
officials to believe such dress and grooming will disrupt, interfere with, or detract from school
activities. Students must always be dress appropriately for the event being attended.
It shall be the responsibility of each building principal/ assistant principal to ensure that these
standards are strictly and consistently enforced without regard to sex, race, color, creed, or national
origin.

In cooperation with teachers, students and parents/guardians, the principal or designee shall establish

The purpose of the dress code regulations is to help each student to set a standard for his/her personal

reflects on the student and on the school. Common sense dictates that some uniform dress regulations are necessary to maintain order, spirit, scholarship, pride and discipline. Good taste and good grooming are part of learning for both boys and girls. Daily attire need not be expensive to be
attractive and entirely acceptable, but all students must wear clothing which is neat, clean and safe.
Any apparel which draws undue attention to the wearer tends to distract from the educational process
and is therefore inappropriate. Students not meeting the standards will be issued school-provided
clothing; students will be allowed to call home to have a change of clothing brought in as long as doing
so does not interrupt instructional time.
● Student dress and appearance shall not be hazardous to the safety of anyone in school. Any
clothes or style of dress that may cause a threat, have a negative affect or disrupt the
educational process will not be permitted.
● Shoes must be worn at all times; soft sole slippers are prohibited.
● Any clothing, jewelry, accessory, notebook or backpack shall be free of writing, pictures or any
other insignia which are gang related, vulgar, profane, sexually suggestive, advocate racial,
ethnic or religious prejudice or the use of drugs, tobacco or alcohol, guns, or weapons.
● Clothes shall conceal undergarments at all times. Halter tops, off-the-shoulder or low cut tops,
bare midriffs, dresses shorter than mid-thigh are prohibited. Tops must have two shoulder
straps of at least 1 ½ inches wide. Shorts must have a 4 inch inseam or longer.
● No bagging or sagging of clothes is permitted. Pants or shorts must be size-appropriate and
worn at the waist so as undergarments are not showing.
● Bandannas and hairnets are not permitted except for school spirit items.
● Hats must be worn forward or backward. When requested by a staff member, students are to
remove their hats.
● Body piercing ornaments need to be small stud or post; no jewelry that presents a safety hazard
will be allowed.
● Attire which may be used as a weapon is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to chains,
wallet chains and items with spikes or studs.
Exceptions to the dress code may be made for special days or special events. Gang-Related Clothing, Insignia, Symbols and Activities: The Governing Board desires to keep district
schools and students free from threats or harmful influence of any groups or gangs. The type of dress,
apparel, activities, acts, behavior or manner of grooming displayed, reflected or participated in by the
student shall not:
1. Lead school officials to reasonably believe that such behavior, apparel, activities, acts, or other
attributes are gang related and would disrupt or interfere with the school environment or
activity and/or educational objectives;
2. Present a physical safety hazard to self, students, staff and other employees;
3. Create an atmosphere in which a student, staff and other person’s well-being is hindered by
undue pressure, behavior, intimidation, overt gesture or threat of violence; or
4. Imply gang membership or affiliation by written communication, marks, drawing, painting,
design or emblem upon any school or person property or on one’s person.
If the student’s behavior or other attributes are in violation of these provisions, the principal or
designee will request the student to make appropriate correction. If the student refuses, the
parent/guardian will be notified and the principal or designee will take appropriate corrective and
disciplinary action.
No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected due to the
fact that the student does not wear standardized physical education apparel where the failure to wear
such apparel arises from circumstances beyond the student’s control. (Education Code 49066)
(cf. 5121 - Grades/Evaluation of Student Achievement)
The principal, staff, students and parent/guardians at each school may establish reasonable dress and
grooming regulations for times when students are engaged in extracurricular or other special school
activities. "

In an attempt to establish conditions that are favorable to the growth and progress of each individual student, it is felt
by the school administrators and the Graham-Dustin Board of Education that the Dress Code be revised. Although it
is agreed the revised code should be general and flexible, it also should have some specific limitations. These are to
give security to those required to follow the regulations and stability to those who enforce them. All rules apply to
male and female students. Fashion does not dictate what is appropriate for school. When in doubt, don’t wear it!
The Board of Education reserves the right to change the dress code policy at any time and, therefore, gives
the administration the authority to suspend any privileges at any time on an individual basis.
The Dress Code is:
1. Dresses and skirts must be appropriate for school and school-related activities. Backless dresses or
outfits of any type, midriffs, see-through blouses, plunging necklines, spaghetti straps, or low-cut
blouses or dresses are not allowed. No cleavage.
2. Shorts, dresses, and skirts must be conservative in length as deemed appropriate by the administration
(no shorter that 4 inches above the knee). No cutoffs, fringes or slit sides, and underwear type “Tshirts”
such as wife beaters, tank tops, or cutout garments will be allowed.
3. ALL students must wear shoes. House shoes are not permitted. No housecoats, pajama pants, or
blankets are allowed.
4. Shoes with wheels are not permitted. Also all shoes must have non-marking soles
5. Items of wear which display drug culture symbols or logos or slogans, such as alcohol or tobacco
logos, portray guns, or which are profane, in poor taste or otherwise detrimental to the educational
setting are not permitted.
6. Bicycle shorts or exercise type shorts will not be worn without the proper foundation
7. All clothing must be properly fitted and worn with the proper foundation. Shirts that have large
armholes that expose undergarments or body parts are not permitted. Bras must be worn by girls.
8. Bandanas, “Du Rags”, or other items of wear, which have been related to gang recognition, will not be
worn. This includes the hood of any hooded garment. No sagging that shows undergarments.
9. All clothing must be appropriate for school. All clothing must be worn in the manner in which it was
intended. If clothing is not appropriate, students will be required to change. If they must leave school,
they will be considered absent or tardy as warranted. Students sent to the office for violations, which
can be corrected on the spot, will still require a tardy to return to class as their negligence causes them
not to be in class ready to work.
10. There will be no holes above the knee in pants or trousers, shorts or skirts.
11. No chain wallets.
12. Leggings or jeggings are not to be worn without proper outer garments extending down to mid-thigh.
No shorts to be worn over leggings unless the shorts are no shorter than 4 inches above the knee. This
applies to students on the Graham campus grades 5-12.
13. NO HATS are to be worn in any of the school buildings.
It should be understood that appropriate dress for school shall promote cleanliness, modesty, and should not create
distractions within the educational environment. Repeated infractions will result in disciplinary action and the
student being sent home."

Since Franklin High School is recognized as an educational environment and a place of business it is important that students dress in a manner conducive to good health practices and safety regulations. Dress should not hinder the educational process and should present a comfortable atmosphere for students, faculty and staff. If an administrator deems that a student’s form of dress interferes with the educational process or presents an uncomfortable atmosphere, that student will be asked to make appropriate changes.


All students are expected to attend school appropriately dressed and properly groomed. Hats may be worn to school but must be removed upon entering the building and placed in lockers. Clothing that includes logos that in any way glamorizes the use or sale of alcohol/drugs, promotes hatred, or contains a sexually suggestive message, will not be tolerated in school or at school functions.

In general, clothing should not inappropriately expose the body.  Any manner of dress that the administration deems inappropriate due to the fact that it interferes with the educational process or presents an uncomfortable atmosphere will not be tolerated. Also, any chains or other items that can be used as harm-inflicting devices will not be tolerated at Franklin High School.

STUDENT DRESS CODE POLICY
 
The Franklin Public Schools is committed to being a diverse and inclusive community and respects the rights of students to express themselves through their dress.

As such, the responsibility for the dress and appearance of the students will rest with individual students and their parents.  They have the right to determine how the student will dress provided that their attire meets minimum requirements for health and safety and does NOT:

·         Defame, demean or promote violence or aggression against any individual or group

·         Promote the use of alcohol, drugs or tobacco products

·         Reference sexually provocative or explicit content

·         Cause disorder or disruption in the school

Guidelines for student dress, which will be developed and enforced by the administration in individual schools, shall be written in a manner free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, genetic information, disability, pregnancy or a related condition, veteran status, age, or homelessness .

School administrators are authorized to take action in instances where students’ attire does not meet the stated requirements.  Enforcement of the dress code should be done in the least restrictive manner so as to reduce disruption to the student’s school day, minimize the loss of instructional time, and preserve the respect and dignity of both the student and school community.

Student Dress - Board Procedure 3224
Preserving a beneficial learning environment and assuring the safety and well-being of all students are primary concerns of the Tonasket Board of Directors.
Students’ choices in matters of dress should be made in consultation with their parents.
Student dress will only be regulated when, in the judgment of school administrators, there is a reasonable expectation that:
A. A health or safety hazard will be presented by the student's dress or appearance, including possible membership in a gang or hate groups;
B. Damage to school property will result from the student's dress; or
C. A material and substantial disruption of the educational process will result from the students' dress or appearance.
The student’s dress and grooming must not:
A. Lead school officials to reasonably believe that such dress or grooming will disrupt, interfere with, disturb, or detract from the school environment or activity and/or educational objectives.
B. Create a health or other hazard to the student's safety or to the safety of others.
C. Create an atmosphere in which a student, staff, or other person's well-being is hindered by undue pressure, behavior, intimidation, overt gesture or threat of violence; or

E. Presenting prohibited or illegal conduct including, but not limited to, lewd, provocative, sexual, drug, tobacco or alcohol-related messages, or gang-related apparel.
The principal, in connection with the sponsor, coach, or other person in charge of an extracurricular or co-curricular activity, may regulate the dress and grooming of students who participate in the activity if the principal reasonably believes that the student's dress or grooming:
A. Creates a hazard to the student's safety or to the safety of others.
B. Will prevent, interfere with or adversely affect the purpose, direction, or effort required for the activity to achieve its goals.
If the student's dress or grooming is objectionable under these provisions, the principal will request that the student make appropriate corrections. If the student refuses, the principal will notify the parent, if reasonably possible, and request that the parent make the necessary correction. If both the student and parent refuse, the principal will take appropriate disciplinary action. Students may be suspended, if circumstances so warrant. Students who violate provisions of the dress code relating to extracurricular activities may be removed or excluded from the extracurricular activity for such period as the principal may determine. All students will be accorded due process safeguards before any corrective action may be taken.
Specific Dress Code Parameters:
1. Staff need to be able to see student’s eyes and ears (this refers to head coverings, not hair styles) at all times.
2. Hats may only be worn in the high school by high school students.
3. The uniforms of nationally recognized youth organizations, and clothing worn in observance of a student’s religion, are not subject to this policy."

An individual's grooming, the way he or she dresses and how he or she behaves, has a bearing on his or her school progress and how others react to him or her. Good standards of dress and appearance reflect good judgment, poise and increased maturity. Dress and grooming as exemplified by the student body and faculty help to create the personal, responsible and purposeful atmosphere of a good school. It is important for students to take pride in their personal appearance because, among other reasons, prospective employers request the school to provide information concerning the personal appearance and conduct of a student when he or she attended school. It is not the purpose to usurp the responsibility of the home but to set boundaries of acceptability for the entire student body. Dress and grooming should enhance the education process, not detract from it.
The student's personal appearance should project a satisfactory self-image to his or her peer group and faculty. Parents and students are urged to use good judgment and accept responsibility for good grooming and the wearing of acceptable attire while attending school or school-related functions. The school principals and counselors will evaluate all extreme or unusual deviations of dress and grooming and will counsel with students and parents when necessary.
Secondary Dress Code (7.22 - 2.0)
The dress code at Ponca City Public Schools is a part of our total educational program.
Our goal is multifaceted: to encourage a sense of modesty, to create a safe school environment conducive to learning, and most importantly, to help young people learn to make good decisions about the appropriateness of dress for different occasions.
1. Shorts, skirts, and dresses must be at least mid-thigh in length.
2. Excessively tight clothing is prohibited.
3. Clothing will not expose the midriff, any undergarment, cleavage, or full back. Strapless garments are prohibited. Shoulder straps of permitted garments must be a minimum width of three fingers, determined by using the fingers of the person wearing the garment.
4. Street shoes must be worn. Foot wear that can damage or mark carpet or flooring such as cleats or shoe skates may not be worn.
5. Apparel with offensive writing, suggestive slogans or logos that pertain to beer, liquor, drugs, tobacco, or sex is not to be worn. Items which carry connotations of immorality, vulgarity, obscenity, or nudity or promote violence and/or gang activity are not allowed. Such items include but are not limited to articles of clothing, belts, jewelry, or school materials, including backpacks.
6. Caps, hats, visors or other head coverings are not permitted within the school building unless approved by the school administration.
7. In order to promote school spirit, school uniforms normally worn for extracurricular activities or performances may be worn to school on days designated by the activity sponsor and approved by the school administration.
8. Sunglasses shall not be worn in class unless prescribed by a physician.
9. Additional modifications or exceptions to the dress code may be enacted as deemed necessary by the administration.

DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR DRESS CODE VIOLATIONS
Failure to follow the school dress code while at school will result in the following:
1st offense – Student will be given a verbal warning and provided with appropriate clothing.
2nd offense – Student will be given a verbal warning and provided with appropriate clothing. Parents will be contacted.
3rd offense – Student will be sent to ISD for the remainder of the day and will be provided with appropriate clothing. Parents will be contacted.

informing all students and their parents of the Student Dress Code. Parents and students will be
updated as needed on any revisions to the dress code.
The purpose of the student dress code is to reinforce the district’s mission of preparing all students to
be lifelong learners and help prepare them for their post-graduation endeavors. Student attire should
be a reflection of an atmosphere of mutual respect supported by the district and should not be a
distraction to the learning environment. As such, all students are expected to follow the guidelines
below:
1. Recognize that extremely brief garments such as tube tops, net tops, halter tops, spaghetti
 straps, plunging necklines (front and/or back), shorts, skirts, and see through garments are
 not appropriate and therefore, are not permitted.
 2. Ensure that undergarments are completely covered by outerwear and is not visible to others.
3. Footwear is to be worn at all times, as this is an issue of safety. Footwear that is a safety
 hazard will not be allowed.
4. Wearing of hats is not allowed in the classroom except for a religious or medical purpose.
5. Not include items that are vulgar, obscene, libelous or denigrate others because of race,
 color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, or disability.
6. Not promote and/or endorse the use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs and/or encourage
 other illegal or violent activities.
All parents are expected to recognize that the education of their child is a joint responsibility of the
parents and the school community. Parents are expected to support the dress code.
Any student who violates the dress code shall be required to modify his/her appearance to be compliant
with the dress code. Students who refuse to do so will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including in school suspension for the day. Repeated failure to comply with the dress code may result in
in-school or out-of-school suspension.

The district's dress code is established to promote appropriate grooming and hygiene, prevent disruption and avoid safety hazards.
Students who represent the school in a voluntary activity may be required to meet additional dress and grooming standards approved by
the principal and may be denied the opportunity to participate if those standards are not met.
Dress and grooming while in school is basically the responsibility of the student. When dress and/or grooming disrupts the learning
process, affects the individual student, other students, or the learning climate of the school, it becomes a disciplinary matter.
Dress Code:
 Shoes must be worn at all times. Feet must be covered with shoes or sandals (flip flops are acceptable, but not to be worn in the
shop areas, for safety reasons).
 Shirts, blouses or tops cannot show bare midriff or be revealing, and should avoid plunging necklines.
 Undergarments should not be visible at any time.
 Shorts must have a minimum 6” inseam.
 No pajamas allowed except on specified days.
 Clothing bearing inappropriate logos or language, which are obscene, suggestive, or promote tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs, will

All pants must be worn at the waist-- no sagging.
 Any form of dress or grooming, which is considered by staff to be a safety factor or is disruptive to the educational process at
NDHS will be prohibited and is subject to the discretion of the administration.
Violators may be asked to change clothes or be sent home. Students unlucky enough to be sent home to change clothes, may have the
absence recorded as unexcused.

process.
Students will be counseled regarding problems of dress and grooming, and subject to disciplinary action in appropriate cases"

We are aware of the current clothing styles, and we have always respected the individuality of each student to
dress in a way that makes them comfortable. We also recognize that clothing choices are a very personal matter
and a way that our students express themselves, reflect their individual personalities, and exercise their freedom.
However, we also must balance individual freedom with maintaining a learning environment that is free from
distractions and comfortable for everyone. Though we have adapted to changing styles over the years, there are
certain clothing items that are considered distracting or inappropriate attire for school. 
In preparation for the “adult world,” we would like for our students to develop an understanding that
“appropriate” attire is different for social activities/gatherings, a date, the gym, the beach/pool, work, school,
etc. We believe that appropriate attire for school should more closely resemble the “workplace standard.” We
are especially concerned about any attire that exposes undergarments, excessive skin, or inappropriate areas of
the anatomy, and excessively tight-fitting clothing. A list of such clothing may be found in the Code of
Conduct. Specific clothing items prohibited at AHS include (but are not limited to) the following:
● Hats, headbands, bandanas, or other head coverings inside any of the buildings except as provided for
under the “Hats” section (boys and girls).
● Sunglasses.
● Torn clothing, “sagging” pants, tank tops (boys and girls), spaghetti straps, sun dresses, midriff tops,
halters, short skirts/shorts, etc.
● Exercise or biking spandex pants and other excessively tight-fitting clothing.
● T-shirts, or other clothing, that display messages or symbols that are considered to be inappropriate,
offensive, distracting, or in any way disruptive of the educational process.
● Clothes, jewelry, other apparel and/or decals that advocate violence, alcohol and other drug use and/or
distribution; that represent gang activity and/or membership; that advertise obscenities; or that reflect
adversely on persons due to race, gender, creed, national origin, physical, emotional, or intellectual
abilities; or that would cause disruption to the learning environment at any school.
MCPS Policy 7-3.1 also states: “Students shall not at school, on school property, or at school activities wear
or have in their possession any written material that is racially divisive. Examples include clothing, articles,
material or publications or any item that denotes Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nation-White Supremacy, Black Power,
Neo-Nazi, or any hate group, or Confederate flags or articles. This list is not intended to be all inclusive.”
Additionally, shoes must be worn at all times in and around the building.
Administrators and teachers have the authority and responsibility to identify and address inappropriate student
attire. Students who dress inappropriately will be given the opportunity to change or cover their clothing, and
students are expected to respond respectfully. Students failing to respond appropriately to the directives of their
teachers will be referred to an administrator for disciplinary action. Refusal to cooperate and/or repeated
offenses may result in being sent home and/or other disciplinary action. Having attended one or more classes
without being addressed for inappropriate attire does not preclude a student from being referred to an
administrator for disciplinary action later in the day. Any confiscated clothing items (i.e. hats, sunglasses,
bandanas) may be held at the discretion of an administrator."

When the dress of an individual student constitutes a health problem, seems unsuitable for school wear, is a physical danger to any person, or when the student’s manner of dress or grooming causes a disruption or disturbance, the school staff shall take appropriate action to correct the situation. 

Students who violate the rules for school attire will be given the opportunity to correct the situation by changing, turning a shirt inside­-out, covering up, or being sent home to change.  Continuation of such violations may result in a parent conference.  Repeated violations may constitute grounds for suspension.  

Students should consider the following questions when dressing for school:

The primary responsibility for appropriate dress lays with the student and his/her parents/ caregivers.
The school may institute certain restrictions on student dress when there is an overriding, legitimate
school purpose that is more important than the student’s right to dress as they see fit. Since one of the
purposes of the Bourne Public Schools is to create a safe, supportive learning community, and since
appropriate dress reflects positively on the school community, students will be prohibited from wearing
any clothing that detracts from the learning process or otherwise compromises health, safety, or
cleanliness.
We encourage students to dress in a neat and respectful manner that reflects the BPS core values: Be
Safe, Be Responsible, Be Respectful. School is a student’s workplace, and we expect all students to
conform to the following standards of dress:
a. Clothing displaying vulgar writing or symbols or sexual reference is not allowed.
b. Clothing with alcohol, tobacco, or controlled substance references will not be allowed.
c. Footwear should be appropriate and safe for the courses the student will be attending (i.e.
sneakers for PE class)
d. Students are not permitted to wear head coverings (i.e. hats, hoods) during school hours unless
the principal or the principal’s designee grants permission. Students should remove head
coverings as soon as they enter the building. Head coverings should be placed in a student’s
locker at the beginning of the day and not be carried throughout the building during the day. If
they are carried or worn, they may be taken away by a staff member and returned at the
conclusion of the school day.
If a student wears something inappropriate to school, he/she will first be asked change in the nurse’s
office and then may be asked to call a parent/caregiver to request that clothing that is more appropriate
be brought to school. The school will have interim t-shirts or sweatpants so that students may return to
their studies as soon as possible."

The Norwood School Committee finds that a high school dress code is necessary to provide safety, to prevent
disruption and disorder, and to facilitate the educational process. Therefore, in order to maintain reasonable
standards of health, safety, and cleanliness and with advice and input from the Dress Code Committee and the
High School Council (consisting of students, teachers, parents, community members, and administration), the
following dress code has been adopted.
The clothing of the students should be clean and worn in the manner for which it was designed. Students’ dress
should show the respect that we encourage for self and others. Since the primary function of school is
educational, not recreational or social, student dress should be appropriate for the school environment and not
cause a distraction within that setting. If the health and safety of the student is endangered or the proper order
of school is disrupted by a student’s attire or appearance, he/she will be referred to the dean and may be sent
home. Continued failure to comply with the Dress Code of Norwood High School will result in suspension from
school pending a conference with the Principal or his designee. Norwood will make reasonable accommodations
for students with sincerely held religious beliefs or documented medical health issues. This means that, in
appropriate circumstances, the school will make exceptions to the dress code policy. If a student or
parent/guardian requests an accommodation, or a student appears to be out of compliance with the policy and
indicates that the noncompliance may be related to a medical need or a religious belief or practice, Norwood staff will engage in a dialogue with the student and parent/guardian to determine the appropriate course of
action.
Administration/deans reserve the right to determine if certain attire is inappropriate in a school building.
Inappropriate dress shall be defined, but not limited to, an article of clothing that displays or promotes, in
pictures or words, any foul, obscene or offensive language; any tobacco product or the use of tobacco product;
any alcoholic product or the use of any alcoholic product; material of a sexual nature whether explicit or implied;
any illegal substance or the use of illegal substances; acts of actual or implied violence; material reasonably
likely to incite or cause disruption in a racial, religious, ethnic, or other context.
The following are not allowed:
• Bare Midriffs (The top portion of shorts, pants, or skirt must meet the bottom of the shirt/jersey
or sweater)
• Sunglasses
• Hats – must be kept in lockers
• Bandanas
• Head coverings
• Sweat bands
• Visors
• Spiked bracelets
• Heavy gauge chains
• See-through tops when underwear can be seen
• Visible undergarments of any kind (boxers, shorts, thongs, bras)
Students are asked to refrain from wearing excessively short clothing, excessively revealing hemlines,
excessively tight clothing, or clothing that allows the overexposure of a person’s thighs, chest, or stomach.
School-sponsored team and club attire may be worn on special occasions during the school day as long as the
attire complies with the Norwood High School Dress Code.
DRESS CODE VIOLATION DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS
If a dress code violation is extreme, the student will be asked to change his/her attire or they will be sent home
to change.
For violations that are not extreme:
1
st offense: Warning – student asked not to wear the particular clothing again
2
nd
offense: One (1) office detention and the student will be asked to change clothing
3
rd
and subsequent offense: One-day suspension for noncompliance
Any coats, jackets, ski parkas, or other similar outerwear must be secured in the student's locker. Teachers may
also require that all students report to class without their backpacks, and that backpacks are secured in a student's
locker prior to class. This Dress Code shall not be enforced to the extent that it conflicts with religious
observance or a documented medical condition."
"WASHBURN RURAL HIGH","KS","http://usd437.net/schools/wrhs/","DRESS CODE AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE
The general atmosphere of a school must be conducive to learning. If a student’s appearance
attracts undue attention to the extent that it may become a disruptive factor in the educational
process, a staff member will ask the student to make the necessary changes. In the event that the
change does not take place in the time allowed, the student may be subject to further disciplinary
action.
The following list is not all-inclusive:
 No clothing or body adornments with offensive, sexually suggestive, vulgar, profane,
ethnically derogatory messages, pictures, or symbols, illegal substances, drug
paraphernalia, tobacco, alcohol, or depicts violence.
 No articles of jewelry or articles on clothing, which are potentially hazardous, such as

However, the Board of Education requires students to attend school in appropriate dress that meets health and
safety standards and does not interfere with the learning process. The Board also requires students to wear
appropriate protective gear in certain classes (including, but not limited to: home & careers, technology, physical

libelous, or which advocates racial, religious, or gender prejudice. The Superintendent of Schools and other
designated administrative personnel shall have the authority to require a student to change his/her attire should
it, in their opinion, be deemed inappropriate according to the above guidelines. Administrators may discipline
students if their dress or grooming endangers their own or others’ physical health and safety, or if the dress or
grooming is so distractive that it interferes with the learning process. Clothing that is or that bears messages
that are lewd, vulgar, obscene, or sexually provocative, as well as clothing bearing messages advocating illegal
activities, including drug or alcohol use, is likely to distract students from learning and is therefore forbidden.

school community. Students should set a high standard of grooming and appearance for themselves so
they will be pleasant to be near. During their school years, students begin setting patterns for
themselves and their future lives. It is the responsibility of school authorities to help guide the future
adults in the right direction of grooming and appearance. So many times in life, the cleanliness,
neatness, and overall appearance of a person will determine his/her chances of getting that certain job or
receiving the promotion that he/she really deserves. Students should not wear clothing that distracts and
disrupts the educational process. Any article of clothing or adornments that will distract or disrupt the
educational process will not be permitted.
EXAMPLES:
 Unnatural hair color such as blue, green, etc., will not be permitted.
 No clothing shall be worn or brought to school with obscene, vulgar, violent or profane slogans or
pictures, or with advertisements of alcohol, tobacco, or other illegal substances appearing on it.
 No chains or loose straps on clothing due to safety.
 Halter tops and tops that allow bare midriffs or bare sides will not be permitted as a part of a
student’s dress. No shirts with sleeves torn off may be worn.
 No spaghetti strap tops or crop tops will be allowed. No underclothing may be visible. No backless
tops. No oversized extra large t-shirts.
 Shorts may be worn to school that are appropriate. The following clothing articles are deemed
objectionable, and therefore should not be worn to school: bicycle, spandex, body glove, brief
tennis, cutoff sweats (unless hemmed), pajamas or house shoes, boxer or brief-type shorts, tears, or
frayed legs, split legs. Shorts that are shorter than open hand finger tips with extended arms on
outside seam.
 No trench coats or dusters.
 No clothing may be worn that displays holes above the knee. Rule of judgement will be nothing
above open hand finger tips with extended arms on outside seam. Questionable apparel will be
left to the judgement of the administration.
 Hats and other headgear are not to be worn in the building.
 Shoes must be worn at all times.
 Those items required for safety purposes will be worn in individual classes (safety glasses, etc.)
Students who violate this code will be dealt with according to the school discipline policy.
Obviously these rules and regulations do not completely cover the subject of good dress and
grooming. The administration and teachers may set dress code regulations that are appropriate for
specific functions. Other questions or problems that arise will be left to the judgment of the
principal.

holding a desirable job. Knowledge regarding dress, which is appropriate in business and in social situations, is
important. Students are expected to be neat and clean at all times. Expensive, sexually explicit or extreme clothing
is not necessary and is discouraged as school wear. School climate is very important and clearly related to
productivity in the classroom. The following guidelines apply to all students:
Policy

Appropriate Outside Dress for Elementary
Appropriate clothing should be provided for all students. Boots, gloves, hat and snow-pants are suggested
for the winter months, as elementary students will be outside for recess every day. It is highly
recommended that the student’s names are placed on items of clothing that could be lost or misplaced to
enable these items to be returned.
The Potosi School District continues to promote positive attitudes and strong character. As a staff we feel
this needs to be shown in everyone's actions, words, and attire. We are asking that our students refrain from
wearing clothing that does not help to meet this goal. When you choose clothes for your child to wear to
school, please consider the words, pictures, and messages they contain. We feel the negative messages that
are often printed on clothing today are inappropriate and will erode our efforts to create a positive
environment for learning. There are plenty of negative messages in the world today, and we want to avoid
having them seen on our students as they walk down the hallways of our school. Positive words and
positive actions help to build strong character. Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Board will not interfere with the right of students and their parents to make decisions regarding their appearance, except when their choices interfere with the
educational program of the schools.
Accordingly, the District Administrator shall establish such grooming guidelines as are necessary to promote discipline, maintain order, secure the safety of
students, and provide a healthy environment conducive to academic purposes. Such guidelines shall prohibit student dress or grooming practices which:
present a hazard to the health or safety of the student himself/herself or to others in the school; interfere with school work, create disorder, or disrupt the
educational program; cause excessive wear or damage to school property; prevent the student from achieving his/her own educational objectives because of
blocked vision or restricted movement.
Such guidelines shall establish the dress requirements for members of the athletic teams, bands, and other school groups when representing the District at a
public event.
The District Administrator shall develop administrative guidelines to implement this policy which: Designates the principal as the arbiter of student dress
and grooming in his/her building; provide an appeal procedure to review decisions of the building principal in situations involving expressive conduct which
the student believes is legally protected.
Some general guidelines to follow are listed below:.
● Hats and headwear are not to be worn in our building during the school day. Upon entering hte building, headwear (including hats and hoods) must
be removed if requested. If prior administrative approval has been given, hats and headwear will be allowed for special events. Hoods must not be worn over
one’s head during the school day. Sunglasses do not belong in an educational setting. Bandanas and head clothes are considered headwear as well. If anything
is used to bind or hold hair it is generally acceptable. No hoods are to be worn and hats should be kept in lockers from the 1st bell to the last bell.
● No student shall be permitted to wear clothing that is normally identified with gang or gang-related activities (e.g. gang related colors), or which
displays pictures or writing referring to or advertising alcoholic beverages, taverns, alcoholic beverage distributors, tobacco products, weapons or illegal drugs;
which contain sexual references, profanity or obscenity, or which consists of or displays states of undress or nudity. Clothing containing reference to any racial
or otherwise offensive statement will not be permitted.
● Spaghetti strap skirts, tank tops with a strap narrower than 1 inches, halter tops, strapless dresses and clothing which exposes the midriff are not
permitted. A rule of thumb: If your shirt cannot be tucked in, it is not appropriate for our learning community. Cleavage is not to be visible.
● Pants, shorts and skirts must be worn in a fashion in which undergarments are not visible whether the student is standing, sitting or bending. Pants,
shorts and skirts must be worn at the waist level and secured with a belt if necessary. Shorts and skirts must be of a length that reaches at least to the mid-thigh
area.

DRESS CODE VIOLATION HIERARCHY
 A citation will be issued with each offense and placed in the student’s record file. A copy will be sent to the parents as well.
1st offense: Student is given a dress code citation to be signed by parent/guardian and returned to the office. Parent/guardian will
be contacted to bring proper dress requirement. If the parent/guardian cannot be reached, the student will be given suitable attire,
if available.
2nd offense: Student will be assigned to 1 day of detention. Parent/guardian will be contacted to bring proper dress requirement. If
the parent/guardian cannot be reached, the student will be given suitable attire, if available.
3rd offense: Student will receive 1 day of ISS. Parent/guardian will be contacted to bring proper dress requirement. If the parent/
guardian cannot be reached, the student will be given suitable attire, if available.
4th offense: Students will be required to modify their dress to meet appropriate standards for the remainder of the year. (Example 1:
A male student continuing to wear sagging pants will be required to wear a shirt tucked into their pants with a belt at the appropriate
waistline. Example 2: A female student who continues to wear a low cut top may be required to wear a non-revealing shirt such as a
polo or crew neck). Failure to do so will result in at least 2 days ISS.

Students are expected to dress in a fashion that reflects good taste and a style appropriate for a school day.  As in any setting, a certain type of attire is considered appropriate, and at some points, necessary.  In the school setting, students are expected to adhere to reasonable levels of modesty and cleanliness.
When a staff member or administration determines that clothing is inappropriate, the student is expected to accept that decision and comply with the decision. Any manner of dress considered inappropriate will result in the student being asked to change clothing.  Refusal will constitute insubordination.  If a student has to leave school to change clothes it is considered an unexcused absence. The principal or designee will make the final decision of the appropriateness of a student’s attire.
The school also recognizes that there are changes in fashion and that during certain times of the year it does get quite warm in the building.  Those considerations were kept in mind as this policy was drafted, though the guiding principle is that which is appropriate in a school or learning environment.  It is also important to remember that uniforms for some extracurricular activities may not meet guidelines to be worn at school, but are appropriate in the setting in which they are worn.  For example, a swimming suit is appropriate for swim competition and a wrestling singlet is appropriate for wrestling, but neither is appropriate to wear at school.
The following guidelines will be followed:
Students are expected to wear clothing that does not disrupt the school or educational environment.  Dress should be conservative and not revealing.
Shorts, skirts, and cut-offs are to be of a reasonable length.  A general guideline is that they be no shorter than the student’s finger tips when extended naturally to the student’s side.  Because of different body types, judgment will be used and the student will be expected to adhere to the decision.
It is expected that tops for both boys and girls, and dresses for females, adhere to the following expectations:
Sleeveless shirts are allowed as long as 1) there are straps at least one-inch wide over both shoulders, and 2) undergarments are not visible.  Note: Straps that go around the neck do not meet this criterion.  T-shirts commonly worn as underwear do not meet this criterion.  If there are thin straps (less than one-inch wide) or no straps, another top must completely cover the shoulders.
Are not sheer or see-through and the student’s midriff is not exposed.
The shirt has not been altered or ripped such that it is split down the side or has holes in it.  
Sleeveless shirts must have a seam.
Loose fitting pants that hang below the waist and expose a student’s underwear are not allowed.  Pants with excessive rips, tears, and holes are not appropriate.
Students are prohibited from wearing clothing that display direct or indirect obscenities, offensive comments, profanity, vulgarity, negative racial references or slurs, or sexual, alcohol, tobacco, or drug statements or remarks.  References to prohibited conduct are not allowed. 
Head ware, including hats, visors, hoods, caps, bandanas that cover the head, wraps, and scarves are not to be worn in school during the regular school day.  They are to be removed when entering the school and left in the student’s locker.
Shoes are to be worn at all times.  For some classes, specific foot ware may be required for safety and/or health reasons.  
Hair and clothing shall be clean and well groomed.  If a student’s hairstyle is such that is draws unnecessary attention or causes a disruption to the class, he/she will be asked to leave and change the hairstyle.
Coats are not to be worn in the classrooms unless there are problems with the heating system and permission is given by administration.  Blankets are not to be used in school.  
When students dress up for special events during the school day, they are expected to adhere to the same guidelines.
Teachers have the authority to require rules of appearance in areas where such dress might constitute a health or safety hazard, or for special activities and trips sponsored by the school. 
Note: During homecoming week and spring fling, as well as on other designated days, some aspects of the dress code may be relaxed, though the same general guidelines are expected to be adhered to in term of appropriateness.

● The way you dress makes an impression. Be aware of what impression you wish to make.
● The heat is not an excuse to wear less. Research suggests that light cotton and full body cover will make
you cooler than wearing less clothing.
● The way you dress makes a statement about you. Remember that a great deal of research has been done
on dress and attitudes. For the short time you are a student during the year, dress appropriately. What you
do outside of school is up to you and your parents.
In summary, Mahopac High School does have a dress code. The Board of Education official Dress Code is available
through the policy manual in the principal’s office. It is summarized below. Most of it is common sense. The school
is obligated to provide an atmosphere that supports student success in the classroom. Students in violation of the
dress code will be notified and will be given time to correct the problem during the school day. Repeated violations or
those that involve insubordination will be referred to the assistant principal and may result in parent contact and/or
disciplinary consequences.
All students are expected to give proper attention to personal cleanliness and to dress appropriately. An individual’s
appearance does have a bearing on how he/she behaves and how others react to him/her. Students and their
parents have the primary responsibility for acceptable student dress and appearance. Teachers and all other district
45
personnel should exemplify and reinforce acceptable student dress and help students develop an understanding of
appropriate appearance in the school setting. A student’s dress, grooming and appearance shall:
1. Be safe, appropriate and not disrupt or interfere with the educational process.
2. Recognize that extremely brief garments such as tube tops, net tops, halter tops, spaghetti straps, plunging
necklines (front and/or back) and see-through garments are not appropriate.
a. At the High School level, shirts must have sleeves.
b. Shorts, skirts, dresses should be of appropriate style and length. As a general guideline, the
length of the student’s shorts, skirt or dress should surpass the length of the student’s fingertips
when their arm is down to their side.
3. Ensure that underwear is completely covered with outer clothing.
4. Include footwear at all times. Footwear that is a safety hazard will not be allowed. Footwear with wheels is
prohibited. No bare feet – or slippers.

religion, creed, national origin, ethnic group, religious practice, gender (identity or expression), sex, sexual
orientation or disability.
6. Not promote and/or endorse the use of alcohol, tobacco, vaping, e-cigarette, or illegal drugs and/or
encourage other illegal or violent activities.
7. Not include sunglasses unless medically warranted and deemed so by a physician.

9. Not include clothing that advocates gang identity.
Students who violate the student dress code shall be required to modify their appearance by covering or removing
the offending item, and if necessary or practical, replacing it with an acceptable item. Any student who refuses to do
so shall be subject to discipline, up to and including in-school suspension for the day. Any student who repeatedly

appearance of students enrolled in the district normally rests with the students and their parents. It is
the responsibility of the school district to prohibit students from attending school when their personal
appearance or attire is of a nature which interferes with the instructional purposes of the school
district or attracts undue attention which is detrimental to the normal operation of the school district.
(Board of Education Policy 5511) When a student’s appearance disrupts the educational process or
causes a health or safety problem, he/she may be referred to the building administration for possible
action. Since styles of dress change rapidly, the administration will interpret this policy and may restrict
certain styles deemed distracting to the learning environment. The following are examples of clothing
that are inappropriate:
▪ Student dress may not promote racial, ethnic or other types of discrimination, obscenities, sex,
drugs, alcohol, or tobacco products.
▪ Clothing that displays undergarments, cleavage, strapless, or tops that expose the midriff are not
appropriate during instructional hours and will not be allowed. These garments, when worn
appropriately with others in a layered fashion that complies, are acceptable.
▪ Any clothing with inappropriate (profane, vulgar, sexually explicit or suggestive, racially or
ethnically offensive, alcohol, drug or gang-related) sayings, slogans or graphics will not be allowed.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive.
▪ Any adornments (i.e. chains, spiked neck collars, etc.) that could be considered potentially
dangerous will be prohibited.
▪ Hats or jackets may not be worn in school. Students are expected to remove these items and place
them in their lockers upon entering the building. Head coverings include, but are not limited to:
caps, hats, hoods, and bandanas. All head coverings should be placed in student lockers during the
school day.
▪ Slippers and any item of clothing resembling pajamas are not to be worn at school.
▪ The wearing of arm-bands, buttons, or badges bearing slogans or sayings shall be permitted unless
obscene, according to current legal standards, libelous, or likely to create a clear and present
danger because of the commission of unlawful acts, or it disrupts the operation of the school.
Student dress at extra and co-curricular activities, dances, and other school-sponsored events shall be
appropriate, not disruptive to the activity, and ensure health and safety. (School Board Policy 5511)"

Student Dress Standards: Per Education Code 35183.5, each school site may set a policy related to sun-protective clothing.
School approved, unaltered, head coverings in school colors with an official school logo, are allowed. Other head coverings
are not allowed unless religiously affiliated. Head coverings must be worn outdoors only. Hats and visors worn outdoors must
be worn with the bill facing forward to provide facial protection. Clothing, jewelry or accessories that are determined by the
administration and/or law enforcement agenciesto represent or support a gang/crew or the gang/crew lifestyle or are considered
to create a hostile and/or intimidating educational environment, are not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to hair nets,
hoods, sweatshirts that zip up through the hood, bandanas, sports clothing aligned with gangs, knee-length socks that hit the
short hemline, overly large items of clothing, sagging pants and pants cut at the calf.
Clothing that is revealing is not allowed. This includes overly-tight clothing, such as leggings/yoga pants that stretch to the
point of being see-through, revealing torn jeans, bare midriffs, backless outfits, plunging necklines/backlines, tube/bandeau
tops, short hemlines/shorts (must cover posterior), sleepwear (including slippers), see-through/sheer attire, beachwear and tank

individual or set of individuals are not allowed.
Sunglasses may not be worn during class time. Earrings, jewelry (such as large rings or belt buckles, spiked/sharp jewelry) or
clothing which present a safety hazard are not allowed. Chains such as those attached to belts or wallets present a safety
hazard and, therefore, are not allowed.
The Board allows student possession or use of electronic communication devices on a school campus; however, it does not
assume liability if such devices are damaged, lost or stolen. All electronic communication devices are to be completely turned
off (including any text messaging functions) inside a classroom during the instructional day, unless directed by the teacher
and/or administrator, as well as during outdoor classes, assemblies, meetings and other school-day activities. Inappropriate use
of an electronic device or accessory will result in disciplinary action and may include confiscation of the device.
Skin art that promotes activities or products not allowed by the dress standards must be covered by an appropriate article
of clothing.
Individual school sites may prohibit anything it deems to be disruptive, distracting, provocative, provoking, and/or intimidating
that in the school’s view rises to the level of having a detrimental effect on the safe and educational atmosphere of the school
environment.
The school reserves the right at any time to amend this list without prior warning to the student/family.
Consequences: All students are expected to comply with the District’s dress standards. Failure to comply will be considered a
form of defiance and will result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension/administrative transfer from the school."

Council accepts the opinion that how a student is dressed is the responsibility of the parent except in the
instance when the appearance and dress of the student can disrupt the educational environment. Students are
encouraged to wear clothes suitable to the learning environment, covering from the shoulders to mid-thigh and
with an appropriate neckline. This includes clothing that is clean, neat and in good taste.Clothing and accessories that are considered inappropriate include:
T-shirts that promote sex, violence and drugs.
T-shirts or other clothes that are sexually suggestive (too tight, too short, too low,see-through
materials).
Clothes, accessories or inappropriate make-up that teachers, students or other staff find offensive
because they cause disruption in the classroom.
Clothes or scarves that may incite confrontations between students.
Abbreviated attire similar to what would be appropriate for beach or physical education activity
including tank tops and shirts with thin straps. From shoulders to mid-thigh must be covered.
Hats, head coverings, with the exception of religious headwear, and bare feet are not allowed. Flip-flops
can be hazardous.

"VAN HORN HIGH","MO","https://www.isdschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-19-ISD-High-Schools-Student-Handbook.pdf","The High School believes that respect for oneself and respect for the greater community of
students and staff is reflected in the way one chooses to dress. The way a student chooses to
dress should not be distraction or a disruption to the learning environment of others. Therefore,
students should wear clothing that is appropriate for school and is not distracting, disrespectful,
offensive, or unsafe. The following guidelines have been adopted to help advise students on
proper and appropriate attire Students must be covered adequately. Because revealing clothing can be distracting to the
learning process, the following guidelines must be followed when choosing apparel for
school:
▪ Shirts must have straps of at least 2 inches and completely cover the chest, back, and
stomach.
▪ Sheer fabrics may be worn only if clothing providing appropriate coverage is worn
underneath.
▪ Undergarments may not be showing at any time. Clothing must completely cover the
student’s undergarments both sitting and standing.
▪ Pants, jeans, shorts, skirts, and dresses must provide adequate coverage of the
student’s legs, buttocks, abdomen, lower back, and undergarments both sitting and
standing.
24
▪ Pants must be worn around your waist. Because loose pants or shorts that appear in
danger of falling off send a sexually inappropriate message and are not acceptable
clothing for school.
2. Clothing is considered inappropriate that promote substances or acts that are illegal in a
public school, and clothing that makes specific or innuendo references to alcohol, drugs,
tobacco, violent behavior or sexual activity is unacceptable. Clothing that depicts
discrimination against others based on their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, physical
disability, or sexual orientation, and clothing deemed disrespectful of any of these groups is
unacceptable. This guideline includes all jewelry and accessories worn in school.
3. Hats and headgear are not permitted. In many social settings, it is considered disrespectful
to wear a hat indoors; therefore hats are not to be worn or displayed from the moment you
enter the building to the conclusion of the school day. Furthermore, hats and headgear
make the efficient identification of students difficult for faculty. Hats and headgear include
baseball caps, skull caps, hoodies pulled up over the head, bandanas, scarves, and athletic
head/sweatbands. Students must contact their administrator to gain permission for head
coverings worn for religious or medical purposes.
4. Soled shoes must be worn at all times. Because a fire or weather emergency could cause
unsafe debris on the floor, soled shoes must be worn at all times. Soft-soled house shoes or
slippers are considered unsafe, as they would not provide adequate protection for students’
feet in an emergency situation.
5. Sunglasses may not be displayed in any manner. Sunglasses interfere with students’ ability
to read and make eye contact with other students and staff. Sunglasses also inhibit the
ability of the faculty to safely identify students. Sunglasses are not permitted inside the
building, unless under a doctor’s prescription.
6. Face paint or overly dramatic make-up may not be worn. Make-up or face paint worn so as
to obscure students’ features makes it difficult to quickly identify students. Because this
could create an unsafe environment, face paint is not permitted, and make-up that obscures
student features is also not permitted.
7. No chains over 12 inches and no spiked bracelets or necklaces are permitted.
8. No blankets shall be carried or worn as coats or to wrap up in while in the classroom. The
temperature in the building is regulated according to the outside temperature and kept at a
comfortable setting for the learning environment of the student.
Because we believe our students are capable of dressing appropriately within these guidelines,
any faculty member has the right to address dress code violations. Should it become necessary
for a student to miss class time in order to correct his or her clothing, the time missed is
considered unexcused.
▪ Violation 1 – Warning and modification required.
▪ Violation 2 – Provided modification, if possible, and parental contact.
▪ Violation 3 and beyond – Sent home for appropriate clothing. Not an excused absence.
As fashion trends develop, the administration may determine other styles of clothing are not
appropriate, and it is they who have the final right to decide what is acceptable attire for school.
